# PlasterBuild

The PlasterBuild module provides following functionality:

* Commands commonly used during the "build" of a PowerShell module.
* A versioned build script that can be use to build, test, install and publish your PowerShell module.
* Plaster templates to create an advanced PowerShell module project that uses the PlasterBuild build scripts.

> **NOTE:** This project is at a very early phase of development.  We have not officially
> launched this project yet but we're opening up the repo for early feedback from the
> PowerShell community.  Please try it out and let us know what you think!
