# Microsoft.PowerShell.Kubectl

This repo contains some of my experiments with native application wrapping.

[Wrapping Native Commands](doc/Wrapping.Native.Commands.md) is a copy of the blog posts that I wrote to describe how I thought it might be possible to automatically generate wrappers for native executables using help output.
They should help you get started.

[Kubernetes on Docker](doc/Kubernetes.on.Docker.md) is a short description on how to set up kubernetes so you can get started more quickly. I built these instructions from a number of different sources I found on the net.

There's not much to setup in the module itself, you can install the module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com/).

You're welcome to provide feedback and suggestions and concerns.
Just open an issue.
I can't promise I'll respond quickly, but I will be continuing to work on this to see how far I can get.
