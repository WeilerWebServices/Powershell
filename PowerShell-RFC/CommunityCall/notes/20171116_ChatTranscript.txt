Yup

Trevor Sullivan 9:31 AM:
Send-SkypeMessage -Text 'Hello PowerShell Core community.'
Mark Kraus 9:32 AM:

hello everyone!
Mark Kraus 9:33 AM:

yup first one.. actually bailed out of a meeting to make this... :)
michaeltlombardi 9:33 AM:

\o/
Trevor Sullivan 9:33 AM:
Nope
Trevor Sullivan 9:34 AM:
All good now
Keith Hill 9:36 AM:

If only there was a language where you could automate many of these release activities. :-)
Joey Aiello 9:38 AM:

I'll add that to the agenda, Steve might have an update to share there
Castillo, Joshua 9:39 AM:

PSGradle?
Castillo, Joshua 9:39 AM:

:)
Keith Hill 9:39 AM:

On to 6.1..
Trevor Sullivan 9:43 AM:
Any plans to ramp up focus on VSCode PowerShell? It’s already great, just needs some more polishing.
Joel Bennett 9:43 AM:

Is there anything we can do to further the release of a 5.1 version of PowerShellStandard.Library?
Keith Hill 9:43 AM:

Yeah, +1 for Joel said.
Trevor Sullivan 9:45 AM:
I know David recently moved on, but curious if there are plans to fill the huge gap that his absence creates.
Keith Hill 9:47 AM:

Tyler Leonhardt is taking over for David - last I heard. He&apos;s working on pushing out a 1.5.1 patch release.
Keith Hill 9:49 AM:

Can we get enhanced module manifest support for cross-platform added to 6.1 list? Like how do I declare a command is exported only on Windows, or a module is required only Windows, etc.
Trevor Sullivan 9:51 AM:
No real feature requests for VSCode PowerShell. Some improved reliability would be really helpful though. It seems to hang a lot.
Keith Hill 9:53 AM:

@trevor - agreed. Attach to PSHost process is broken atm. Debugging on Linux/macOS also has issues.
Trevor Sullivan 9:55 AM:
It’s hard to reproduce hangs in VSCode PowerShell, but I’ll keep an eye on the existing issues if there’s something exceptionally serious. Thanks Steve!
Mark Kraus 9:55 AM:

is there some kind of initiative for pre-GA Documentation refresh?
michaeltlombardi 9:55 AM:

\o/
Trevor Sullivan 9:55 AM:
Perhaps Tyler, or whomever, could add some telemetry to help gather data around VSCode PowerShell hangs?
michaeltlombardi 9:55 AM:

(y) docs
Sean Wheeler 9:56 AM:

Not DSC - AzurePS
Trevor Sullivan 10:00 AM:
Telemetry would probably make it easier to debug the hangs and buggy behavior. Not sure how much of it is the fault of VSCode itself vs. the extension for PowerShell.
Keith Hill 10:01 AM:

VSCode is little more than an orchestrator for debugging so most (if not all) issues are in the extension.
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:02 AM:

there is a new issue for that: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5477
Keith Hill 10:03 AM:

FFO - isnt&apos; that the new buzzword? Fix forward only, right?
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:08 AM:

https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/tree/master/CommunityCall
Keith Hill 10:08 AM:

FYI, we use something like this internally for signing binaries - https://github.com/onovotny/SignService
Keith Hill 10:10 AM:

Gotcha. 
Eric Weilnau 10:10 AM:

that&apos;s a good thing
Trevor Sullivan 10:10 AM:
Just use blockchain for everything, to establish trust. Everyone’s doing it!!!!!
Ben Gelens 10:11 AM:
Any news on dsc core?
Trevor Sullivan 10:11 AM:
I’d suggest avoiding DSC in Core, and focus on doing what PowerShell does well.
Joel Bennett 10:12 AM:

They suggested PowerShell + Python + C/native
Trevor Sullivan 10:13 AM:
DSC is a cool concept on Windows, but it feels distant from PowerShell, despite the syntactical similarities.
Mark Kraus 10:15 AM:

What kind of guidance can you provide on new features that are not fully cross-platform compatible? (i.e. CoreFX limitations on macOS) is there a minimal number of platforms a feature must work on to be accepted?
Mark Kraus 10:22 AM:

:)
Keith Hill 10:22 AM:

Thank you for IWR -Auth - already been using it!
Mark Kraus 10:22 AM:

me too... that's why I added it :)
Joel Bennett 10:24 AM:

LOL
Jeremiah Strong 10:24 AM:

I like skype :)
Trevor Sullivan 10:24 AM:
Skype is great, IMO. Works very well on Mac.
Bobby Cannon 10:24 AM:

Anything, just want to listen in
Trevor Sullivan 10:24 AM:
Please don’t use WebEx. Whatever you do, don’t use WebEx.
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:24 AM:

I don't mind which platform, but at least moving away from Skype for Business would be great because I only have 'normal' Skype at home and have to stay at work therefore
Keith Hill 10:24 AM:

For future conf calls, as Steve now owns some of this other PS tooling support, can we maybe add VSCode extension to the call? I mean we talked about it today but it would be good to have the devs here.
Jeremiah Strong 10:24 AM:

Skype Web App?
Eric Weilnau 10:25 AM:

yeah
Joel Bennett 10:25 AM:

I join in Skype4b
Trevor Sullivan 10:25 AM:
Skype for Business on Mac actually looks even better than the Windows version. Just grabbed it this morning.
Keith Hill 10:25 AM:

+1
Andrew Bradley 10:25 AM:
Skype works fine because it doesn't force us to login or anything. Easy enough
Eric Weilnau 10:25 AM:

it does. I am on the web without an account
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:25 AM:

Thanks for the tip with the web app, I'll try it next time. :-)
Keith Hill 10:26 AM:

Thx!
Nicholas M. Getchell 10:26 AM:

Thanks PS team
Darwin Sanoy 10:26 AM:

Thanks much!
Mark Kraus 10:26 AM:
