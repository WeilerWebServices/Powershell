## Agenda

* Coverage
* PS Standard
* PRs
* IoT
* Editor Services
* Script Analyzer
* SSH

## Notes

* Joey has been working on coverage with module owners across Microsoft
    * Azure PowerShell already making good progress with AzureRm.NetCore module
    * Starting conversations with Windows/Office including AD, AAD, Exchange, and others
    * No promises or ETAs, but we are making progress!
* PS Standard 5.1 preview out by end of Feb - https://github.com/powershell/powershellstandard
* Question was asked about hosting PSCore
    * docs are here for now: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/docs/host-powershell
    * This has our MyGet feed: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/host-powershell/sample-dotnet2.0-powershell.beta.3/NuGet.config
* Joey talked about breaking down the monolith and separating into components - help being an example
    * dev tools pack, mixed feelings (Microsoft "picking a winner")
* PR backlog: we know it's important, and we'll get to it
    * Merge privileges for community maintainers?
    * We think it makes a lot of sense, definitely an eventual desire, so we'll talk internally
* Windows Update for PSCore
* Get-PSUpdate cmdlet - we should have this, question is with the implementation (Update-PSCore)
    * PRs always welcome ðŸ˜„, also Chocolatey was mentioned
    * maybe a NuGet feed of Chocolatey packages that are MS blessed for installing pwsh and similar apps 
    * We'll talk about this internally, but no promises
* SCCM or Intune for a fleet of macbooks - tell SCCM team on UserVoice
* Script Analyzer update
    * All PRs are dealt with in some way
    * Getting PSSA consistent with other PowerShell repos
    * New release soon
    * Added new maintainer
    * We should look at the rules again
        * For targeting specific editions/versions/platforms, for example:
            * Now: goes back as far as v3 (but not 100% fleshed out)
            * Future: not going to work on a particular OS, actually fleshed out
    * Question: Why C# is the only language a rule can be merged in as
        * We should support other languages/forms, totally reasonable
        * Jim will address it - https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/743
    * PSSA will have more features
* IoT module being worked on by Andrew and Tyler
    * not open-sourced yet
    * conservative (i.e. worst case) ETA: "probably a couple of months"
    * Module for messing with GPIO and sensors
    * Possibly demo or video coming up showing some lights and water pumps working
* Editor Services
    * 1.6.0 release coming soon
    * Patrick working on PSReadline within VS Code
        * Roughly targeting 1.7.0 for release of this
    * Talking more at MVP Summit, as well as PowerShell Summit NA in April
* SSH
    * Git for windows using own SSH
    * Question: What will having SSH in win32 mean for updates via chocolatey?
    * Win32-OpenSSH ships as a "Windows Feature on Demand" on by default can be removed
    * Available in Desktop, Server, Server Core
    * Recommendation from Darwin
        * should be off by default
        * worry about systems that already have SSH (other implementations) installed
    * Joey will get in contact with Darwin to get more feedback <-
    * Tough balance between making it easy to access and not breaking people
        * system32 is (mostly) immutable, and upgrades old goes to Windows.old, you get that with everything (Windows Update)
* docs: refactored table of context
    * need feedback
    * will port over remaining MSDN docs to docs.microsoft.com
* PSReadLine 2 in PSCore
    * 6.1? maybe
    * PSReadLine 2.0 very likely going to Windows PowerShell
