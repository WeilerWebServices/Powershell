Muted Joey = Sad Joey
Joel Francis 9:40 AM: 
Not this meme again! :D 
Romero126 9:42 AM: 
Good Morning!
Joel Francis 9:42 AM: 
Hiya rom!
Paul DiMaggio 9:45 AM: 
WOOO
Joel Francis 9:49 AM: 
Fyi fellas, looks like the dial-in conference ID has changed / expired / something. Fellow on the #powershell IRC isn't able to get in from the UK dial in number with the currently published ID: 4334578
Mark Kraus 9:51 AM: 
progress!
Keith Hill 9:51 AM: 
Is there a Set-ExperimentalFeature or do you have to munge a config json file?
Kirk Munro 9:51 AM: 
Glad to hear that RFCs are no longer a place where ideas go to die.
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:52 AM: 
@keith, currently you have to hand craft the config json file. I’m hoping cmdets show up in preview3 to make this easy
Keith Hill 9:53 AM: 
Guess Enable-ExperimentalFeature would be a better name.
Joel Francis 9:53 AM: 
Just use discord lol
Domansky, Mark 9:53 AM: 
Move to Teams: +1, works for my Office Hours weekly call.
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:53 AM: 
@keith, look at my RFC https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/148/files
Joel Francis 9:53 AM: 
;)
Keith Hill 9:54 AM: 
(y)
Joel Francis 9:54 AM: 
My wife says hi btw (heart) 
Kirk Munro 9:54 AM: 
General feedback: the RFC process feels slow (not just because it's been low priority...the process itself seems designed to be quite slow).
Ryan Yates 9:55 AM: 
Can you show more of the notes as I joined a little late
Joel Francis 9:55 AM: 
Indeed. Should I be looking to write an RFC for proposed behaviours for pr#7993?
Keith Hill 9:56 AM: 
Some changes should be a bit slow particularly to avoid breaking changes. Yeah, what Joey is saying now ...
Mark Kraus 9:56 AM: 
joey/steve: I added https://aka.ms/PSCommunityCall and set you 2 as owners
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:57 AM: 
Thanks @mark!
Joel Francis 10:01 AM: 
(y) sounds good
Ryan Yates 10:01 AM: 
Yup
PowerCode 10:01 AM: 
I wonder abit about your 
poshizzle 10:01 AM: 
(y)
Ryan Yates 10:02 AM: 
some debt??? Just some.......:O
PowerCode 10:02 AM: 
I'd like to hear your views on major breaking changes. It that an option, if it would enable substantial performance improvements? 
Ryan Yates 10:08 AM: 
Thanks @Steve :-)
Paul DiMaggio 10:09 AM: 
really like that
Ryan Yates 10:10 AM: 
So Tab Completion based on the Capitilsation in the Function/cmdlet names
Mark Kraus 10:10 AM: 
Now it is time to start chosing cmdlet names based on fun abbreviations...
Romero126 10:10 AM: 
I hear Daxxion is working on a security module. is there any public details on that?
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:10 AM: 
:)
Ryan Yates 10:11 AM: 
Hey Sidney 
Ryan Yates 10:11 AM: 
(wave)(wave)(wave)
Ryan Yates 10:12 AM: 
GH Projects using GH Labels will work well
Keith Hill 10:13 AM: 
seeminglyscience
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:13 AM: 
no, @seeminglyscience
Aleksandar 10:13 AM: 
any plans for bringing back Out-GridView and some other GUI-related commands?
Kirk Munro 10:13 AM: 
Sidney, are you working towards making PowerShellGet much easier to use (remove the annoying errors, fix the update all scenario, fix the performance, etc.). Also, FxCop-like support for binary modules, and PSModuleAnalyzer.
Kirk Munro 10:14 AM: 
(y)
Edwin Young 10:15 AM: 
I have wondered about binary modules too. Do we see those as in scope for PSSA? The whole thing is focused around powershell AST today...
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:15 AM: 
@edwin, I think it’s a different tool
Ryan Yates 10:16 AM: 
Sounds good to me :-)
Edwin Young 10:16 AM: 
i'm used to it
Aleksandar 10:17 AM: 
PowerShell Core support in Azure Automation service?
Keith Hill 10:17 AM: 
Seems like you'd need a Rosyln-based code analyzer for binary module development. Does the team have such a beast for internal use?
Joey Aiello 10:17 AM: 
Aiello
Joey Aiello 10:17 AM: 
Joey
Ryan Yates 10:19 AM: 
the runtime in functions will be v6 yes?
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:19 AM: 
yes
Aleksandar 10:19 AM: 
Has anyone tried to deploy Az to Azure Automation?
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:19 AM: 
there’s work by AzAuto team to support that…
Aleksandar 10:20 AM: 
I think "Deploy to Azure Automation" option should be removed from PSGallery
Aleksandar 10:20 AM: 
for Az modules
PowerCode 10:21 AM: 
I'm thinking on the level of rewriting PSOBject
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:22 AM: 
I’m intrigued
Kirk Munro 10:26 AM: 
Not related to what Joey is currently saying: I'd love to get some attention on issues #7703 (designing modules for multi-runspace/multi-threaded use) and #8192 (module guidance on how to properly handle credential caching). Docs are definitely needed, plus possibly some features/functionality in PS itself.
Sean Wheeler 10:26 AM: 
+1 for fsprovider v2
PowerCode 10:27 AM: 
@Steve That is when when we pick it up when we're not bogged down by work :)
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:28 AM: 
(y)
Joel Francis 10:28 AM: 
Heh, good point
PowerCode 10:28 AM: 
Will there be a pwsh 7.0
Joey Aiello 10:28 AM: 
:) unclear
Joey Aiello 10:29 AM: 
We need to work out branch strategy once .NET Core 3.0 come into play
Joel Francis 10:29 AM: 
Let's just skip to 10.0
Joel Francis 10:29 AM: 
Like Windows :P
PowerCode 10:29 AM: 
Because that would be a nice window ;)
Aleksandar 10:29 AM: 
JEA in remoting over SSH?
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:29 AM: 
PowerShell X
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:29 AM: 
JEA over SSH is in the backlog, not in 6.2
Romero126 10:29 AM: 
Is there a plan to grab more granular control over security locking down cmdlets / or unlocking specific types? Kind of like an ACL for a firewall?
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:30 AM: 
Please open an issue on what you need in terms of granularity
Edwin Young 10:30 AM: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/jea/overview  ?
Romero126 10:30 AM: 
Will do XD Thanks Steve. 
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:30 AM: 
https://aka.ms/jeadocs
Sean Wheeler 10:31 AM: 
Also, I forgot to mention the new feedback feature in the Docs
Joel Francis 10:31 AM: 
Thanks guys!
Joel Francis 10:31 AM: 
Have a good day everyone (heart) 
Ryan Yates 10:32 AM: 
That sounds like a really useful change Joey
corey webster 10:33 AM: 
Thanks. Excellent Info. 
Keith Hill 10:33 AM: 
Thanks!
Cat, Francois-Xavier (EUT & BTO) 10:33 AM:
