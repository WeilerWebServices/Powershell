# PowerShell Community Call Notes for Dec. 08, 2016 (Audio recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_i0He9jauY))

* Rejecting [RFC0011](../X-Rejected/RFC0011-Dot-Referencing-With-Static-Integers.md) on the basis that people can have folders full of scripts that begin with a number
* Accepting [RFC0012](../4-Experimental-Accepted/RFC0010-SSH-Remoting-Cmdlets.md) for SSH parameter sets, but we should generally fix the parameter set problem:
	- Kirk is willing to take on an RFC for better Formatting and Output of `Get-Command -Syntax`
	- We should also close on the RFC for mutually exclusive parameter sets
* [#2290: Add Get-FileEncoding cmdlet or function.](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/issues/2290)
	- Generally agree that `Get-FileEncoding` and `ConvertFrom-FileEncoding` would be useful, especially as we move to a cross-plat world (PowerShell on Linux, Bash on Windows, etc)
	- Kirk points out that it would be useful to have this functionality downlevel, and so putting it in Utility might be undesirable
* [#1103: PowerShell Scripts require .ps1 extension](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/issues/1103)
	- Without any regard for perf, we probably want to allow no extension AND a shebang
	- HOWEVER, `Get-Command` will probably slow down due to having to open every file with a `+x` flag. 
	- Current POR: Remove the requirement for a file extension and see how the perf impacts Get-Command and tab completion. 
* [#621: Fix Remove-Item <symbolic link to directory>](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/issues/621)
	- Committee agrees that removing a symbolic link should not require `-Force`
	- We should also fix the bug in 5.1 where the link doesn't ever get removed
	- `Remove-Item` should never remove the contents of a link's target when removing the link (even w/ `-Force` or `-Recurse`)
* [#2820: Empty key name converting to PSObject](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/2820)
* Given the improvements being made to the Utility module, it would be useful to have those changes on downlevel versions of PowerShell (kind of like how we ship Archive today)
