Trevor Sullivan 9:34 AM: 
Is the OMI / PSRP remoting component going to be "built-in" to PowerShell, or will it stay as a separate package?
Trevor Sullivan 9:34 AM: 
Sorry can&apos;t unmute
Trevor Sullivan 9:34 AM: 
In another meeting.
Trevor Sullivan 9:34 AM: 
Just looking to see how easy it is to simplify deployment.
Trevor Sullivan 9:34 AM: 
Yep anywhere, client server
Trevor Sullivan 9:35 AM: 
WS-Man and SSH based
Trevor Sullivan 9:35 AM: 
eg. WS-Man outbound to Windows Server
Trevor Sullivan 9:35 AM: 
or SSH based to Linux or Mac
Trevor Sullivan 9:36 AM: 
Is this exclusive to Core Edition? Or does it work across Desktop and Core?
Trevor Sullivan 9:37 AM: 
I&apos;ve heard remoting is working today, but haven&apos;t seen how to actually use it. Looks complex to set up at the moment.

Here&apos;s an example scenario: I would like to deploy a Docker-on-Linux microservice that remotely triggers jobs on Windows Server.
Trevor Sullivan 9:39 AM: 
Thanks for the link. I&apos;ll have to try that out.
Trevor Sullivan 9:40 AM: 
Doable today? WOW, awesome.
Joey Aiello 9:40 AM: 
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/1-Draft/RFC0012-Enable-SSH-Remoting.md
Trevor Sullivan 9:40 AM: 
I&apos;ll take a look at the RFC. Wasn&apos;t aware of it. Thanks!
Trevor Sullivan 9:41 AM: 
So Linux --> Windows is NTLM?
Trevor Sullivan 9:41 AM: 
Cool
Joel Bennett 9:41 AM: 
It worries me that the "server" story is SSH Remoting, but that there's no plan on shipping the ssh remoting client end to Windows -- even after you ship OpenSSH in the box!!!?
Joel Bennett 9:42 AM: 
One other thing -- I mentioned the other day in Slack that PowerShell 6 is not ever going to ship "in the box" and some of the knowledgeable geeks did not know that. I actually had one of our regulars call me out and ask me to cite sources ... which I had a *very* hard time doing. Can we make that clearer?
Trevor Sullivan 9:42 AM: 
My earlier question around Desktop vs. Core Edition was more along the lines of ... can I do Windows --> Linux via Desktop Edition or do I have to use Core Edition for that? A text answer would suffice while you&apos;re responding to Joel.
Joel Bennett 9:44 AM: 
Can we ship it as a store app? ;-)
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:44 AM: 
I have a chocolatey installer out there - but it does not show on public search due to the pre-release version being used.
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:44 AM: 
https://chocolatey.org/packages/powershell-core
Eugene Bekker 9:44 AM: 
Is it is a side-by-side problem with WinPOSH?
Castillo, Joshua 9:44 AM: 
msi  :(
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:46 AM: 
If you use the .zip you can do side by side
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:46 AM: 
MSI is a four letter word ;)
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:47 AM: 
choco install powershell-core -y -pre
Trevor Sullivan 9:48 AM: 
Thanks for distributing Docker containers. This is a perfect story for side-by-side versioning.
Joel Bennett 9:48 AM: 
Well, if I can't remote to my Linux boxes because of missing SSH ... PowerShell 6 inside the store sandbox would be useful -- if it could do SSH :-P
Trevor Sullivan 9:49 AM: 
Could you guys ship a PowerShell container with the OMI / PSRP pre-installed? I would like to debug PowerShell applications running in containers.
Joel Bennett 9:49 AM: 
+1
Joel Bennett 9:49 AM: 
Would use.
Trevor Sullivan 9:50 AM: 
Not sure if SSH or WS-Man. I&apos;m confused ... is WS-Man supported on Linux??
Trevor Sullivan 9:50 AM: 
Oh, so SSH remoting is built-in?
Castillo, Joshua 9:50 AM: 
+1 docker container/omi...
Trevor Sullivan 9:50 AM: 
Huh ....
Trevor Sullivan 9:50 AM: 
I opened an issue on OMI already
Ben Gelens 9:50 AM: 
Client is build in. Server is not
Trevor Sullivan 9:50 AM: 
Paul H. responded to me, but didn&apos;t have time to try his suggestion.
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:50 AM: 
Can I get volunteers to test the IOS installer in my pull request? I have no idea if it works :) (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3608)
Trevor Sullivan 9:51 AM: 
What I&apos;m trying to accomplish: debug PowerShell in containers. :)
Trevor Sullivan 9:52 AM: 
I&apos;d like to fire up a container, Ã§reate a remote session to it, and then do the typical Enter-PSHostProcess debugging, or attach VSCode-PowerShell extension to it, so I can step through execution.
Castillo, Joshua 9:52 AM: 
Not sure if the debugger is decuppled from vscode, but it needs some love
Jonathan Medd 9:52 AM: 
+1 on a blog post / Github reference around the 6.0 core no plans for shipping out of the box and options for installing on Windows
Castillo, Joshua 9:54 AM: 
Hit it right on the head
Trevor Sullivan 9:54 AM: 
Thanks Joey. :) Don&apos;t care if SSH or WS-Man at this point.
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:56 AM: 
FYI - Latest vscode install wanted to end all my virus protection to install properly. Maybe it was the fault of Restart Manager + my specific machine state and nothing directly to do with the installer?
Ben Gelens 9:56 AM: 
Dsc can be debugged interactive now. Works great for me
Staffan Gustafsson 9:56 AM: 
I have quite a lot of crashes debugging with VS code to
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 9:57 AM: 
Since it&apos;s probably not a good idea to put PSH 6.0 on the path on a Windows machine - maybe a "PSH6PATH" environment variable (hey let&apos;s do JAVA_HOME all over again :D )
Castillo, Joshua 9:57 AM: 
Great, thanks.
Castillo, Joshua 9:58 AM: 
+1 on hosing vscode a few times
Trevor Sullivan 9:58 AM: 
From Mac OS X, I&apos;m trying to remote into a Windows Server instance, and I just get "MI_RESULT_ACCESS_DENIED," even when I specify -Credential. Anyone see this?
Ashley McGlone (GOATEEPFE) 9:59 AM: 
Mac to Windows over SSH works OK for me
Ashley McGlone (GOATEEPFE) 9:59 AM: 
My Windows target was Win10 with OpenSSH
Trevor Sullivan 9:59 AM: 
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName FQDN -Credential (Get-Credential) <--- anything else?
Ashley McGlone (GOATEEPFE) 10:00 AM: 
That would be Wsman, i've not tried that
Ashley McGlone (GOATEEPFE) 10:00 AM: 
Enter-PSSession -Hostname FQDN -Username foo -SSHTransport
Ben Gelens 10:01 AM: 
@trevor, should use authentication basic / nego when doing wsman psrp
Trevor Sullivan 10:01 AM: 
The documentation says there&apos;s a -KeyFilePath parameter on New-PSSession, but that doesn&apos;t exist on my Beta 1 system.
Trevor Sullivan 10:01 AM: 
Thanks @Ben
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:02 AM: 
@trevor, -keyfilepath is part of the ssh parameter set: new-pssession -hostname foo -keyfilepath

Trevor Sullivan 10:05 AM: 
Thanks Joey ... I&apos;ll try Basic authentication for WS-Man.

thx
Darwin Sanoy (Infor) 10:07 AM:

Nicholas M. Getchell 10:08 AM: 
i've seen lots of people make the get-help syntax mistake. Any way to have the functionality of get-command -syntax in the Help?
Trevor Sullivan 10:08 AM: 
Just tried -Authentication Basic to WS-Man, and got "Authentication Failed" :( Any ideas @BenGelens?
Castillo, Joshua 10:09 AM: 
Its a joke :)
Hemant Mahawar 10:09 AM: 
Environmentvariable cmdlets RFC is in PowerShell-RFC repo, specifically https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/92
Ben Gelens 10:09 AM: 
I have a demo on using keyfile on my psconfeu session on youtube
Joey Aiello 10:10 AM: 
@Trevor: the server needs to be setup to accept Basic auth too... :\
Castillo, Joshua 10:10 AM: 
Ben, do you you have a link to the youtube video?
Trevor Sullivan 10:10 AM: 
Ah, good call. Can do that on my test server. Thanks! Didn&apos;t even think about that.

if you're using basic auth, please use https
Ashley McGlone (GOATEEPFE) 10:11 AM: 
Anyone having issues doing SSH remoting INTO a Mac?
Trevor Sullivan 10:11 AM: 
No wonder remoting worked locally, because I was using Kerberos. :) $PSSenderInfo rocks.
Staffan Gustafsson 10:12 AM: 
This works fine:

[io.file]::ReadAllText(&apos;C:/Users/Staffan/.gitconfig&apos;)
Staffan Gustafsson 10:12 AM: 
ah, so it&apos;s win32?
Staffan Gustafsson 10:12 AM: 
I&apos;d like some comments on the developer environment. 
I think we could do a lot to make it a lot easier to getting started contributing to PowerShell if there were working solutions/projects for VSCode/Visual Studio.

Trevor Sullivan 10:15 AM: 
Something I&apos;d be interested in hearing some feedback on ... will we see some increased focus on interop, to aid in building PowerShell modules targeting UNIX native libraries?
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:16 AM: 
Linux coverage is something we're targeting for 6.1.0, but for 6.0.0 we certainly need a better sdk to allow authoring cross platform (and cross ps versions) modules
