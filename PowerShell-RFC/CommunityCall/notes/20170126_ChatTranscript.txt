[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:12 AM]  Jason Shirk:  
Probably not.
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:12 AM]  Eugene Bekker:  
OK, that's what I would expect, just checking

One proto that would work across both platforms would be nice

PSRP over OpenSSH for other endpoints like Storage controllers

All our Linux (CentOS) hosts are AD-joined
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:17 AM]  Bart:  
We want to be able to write a complex script locally and then launch that script over some kind of remoting protocol. Currently, WinRM doesn't support this very well if at all. I'm hoping that SSH will give us that.Â

Is the plan for NTLM/Kerberos support to be implemented in managed code or P/Invoke out to native?
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:19 AM]  Eugene Bekker:  
GSS is what's used by OpenSSH and others
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:19 AM]  alx9r:  
It would be nice to be able to remote in and run as NT Authority\System without using CredSSP and PSExec (there's a double-hop problem).
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:20 AM]  Eugene Bekker:  
:-)
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:20 AM]  alx9r:  
Mainly for testing and troubleshooting.

All our Macs are joined to domain. But I am a powershell nÃ¼b. Just started managing Windows recently. I don't think Mac folks that happen to manage windows would use over shell script or python etc. But windows guys that now manage Macs might use. *shrug*

I'm all about giving telemetry, just be clear on what is shared.

-Telemetry switch on / off?
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:25 AM]  alx9r:  
Thanks @johan
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:25 AM]  Bobby Cannon:  
I love the idea of sharing that data!
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:25 AM]  Bobby Cannon:  
I'd love to see that myself.
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:25 AM]  Bobby Cannon:  
That is excellent.

Don't add non PowerShell-specific aliases, people can add them if required.

[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:30 AM]  Keith Hill:  
This helps with scripts that use ls because if user has ls alias for GCI, how do you get to native ls.
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:31 AM]  Keith Hill:  
Not sure about path , still a Linux n00b
OK yeah it is /bin/ls

no there are some blogs where it states they added it as Primary terminal default
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:41 AM]  Keith Hill:  
OK some community guy submitted that PR and it got accepted to VS Code. +1 for that guy. :-)

[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:57 AM]  Eugene Bekker:  
But, idea is to tackle after 6.0 is released?
 
[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:57 AM]  Bobby Cannon:  
I used PS on Windows to do daily development, side scripts for cleaning, building, etc, I also use it for building windows images using DISM, basically PowerShell is first thing I start followed by VS.

[â€Ž1/â€Ž26/â€Ž2017 9:58 AM]  Keith Hill:  
I'm trying to use PS daily on Ubuntu instead of bash except that the PSReadline bug messing up my prompt it getting annoying. But removing PSReadline makes using PS even more annoying. :-)
