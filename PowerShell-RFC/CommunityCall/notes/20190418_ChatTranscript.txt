Will Snap-ins be added to PS7? Citrix XenApp snap-ins is one of the reasons my organization cannot move to PS Core.

No plans to bring back snapins, we've published a blog to port a snapin to a module and it's pretty straight forward.  Recommend reaching out to Citrix(Will Snap-ins be added to PS7? Citrix XenApp snap-ins is one of the reasons my organization cannot move to PS Core.)

Yeah, I remember back when PowerShell wasn't shipped with Windows and we all said it should be shipped in Windows.

Just a bit of deja-vue on my side.  :-)
