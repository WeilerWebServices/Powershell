Maximo Trinidad 9:33 AM: 
Let me get out 
Kirk Munro 9:35 AM: 
(y)
JimTru 9:35 AM: 
We can see it
Joel Francis 9:35 AM: 
We see you joey
Roberth Strand 9:36 AM: 
We can see :)
MaxTrinidad 9:37 AM: 
Any reason why I can't install PowerShell SDK 6.1.2 from Nuget. :)
Knox, Cory 9:38 AM: 
MaxTrinidad: probably not updated on nuget yet
MaxTrinidad 9:38 AM: 
But it's showing on that page. :(
Keith Hill 9:39 AM: 
RE PSGET - did the "PkgMgmnt / PSGet failed to update because of files in use" bug get fixed?
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:39 AM: 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK/6.1.2  should be there, let me try
MaxTrinidad 9:39 AM: 
And, the find-package cmdlet finds it.
MaxTrinidad 9:40 AM: 
I posted the issue and SteveLee knows it. (y)
IISResetMe (Mathias) 9:40 AM: 
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md <-- no entry for 6.1.2 yet :) 
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:40 AM: 
It there time for perf fixes for 6.2?
Thomas Rayner 9:40 AM: 
Fuzzy matching is so cool
MaxTrinidad 9:40 AM: 
Yiu guys ROCK!! :)
Darwin Sanoy 9:41 AM: 
Chocolatey package was pushed the next day
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:41 AM: 
@staffan, depends on risk/reward
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:41 AM: 
submit them anyways :)
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:42 AM: 
What could possibly go wrong?
IISResetMe (Mathias) 9:42 AM: 
Ahh, yeah, the sorting tricked me
Edwin Young 9:42 AM: 
@Keith Hill, no change there. Because .NET holds open assembly files and we can't unload them in the same process, there is no straightforward way to do this (that we have thought of so far, anyway)
Keith Hill 9:43 AM: 
Thx for the update
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:43 AM: 
@edwin, you can’t replace/remove files in use, but you can rename
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:43 AM: 
the install-powershell.ps1 script in PSCore repo uses this trick to update “in place"
Adil Zia 9:44 AM: 
if we want to start contributing...and say we are beginners... where do we start..and then aim for to continue doing so
MaxTrinidad 9:44 AM: 
Hey guys! Is there a possibility to push update thru Windows Update. Maybe part of the roadmap!
Joey Aiello 9:44 AM: 
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md 
Thomas 9:44 AM: 
To increase the adoption of updatable help, has anyone put some thought into allowing PowerShell Gallery to host help files (.xml and .cab)?
Joel Francis 9:44 AM: 
Also just ask in the PS slack there are usually contributors around to help you get started
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 9:45 AM: 
@Adil - you just start it, community will help. that's my experience
Adil Zia 9:45 AM: 
Thank you
MaxTrinidad 9:45 AM: 
I like the changes to submitting issues!
Darwin Sanoy 9:46 AM: 
gasp!  an untaken pending reboot on Joey's machine :o
MaxTrinidad 9:46 AM: 
(y)
Edwin Young 9:46 AM: 
'up-for-grabs' and 'good first issue' also apply to the PowerShellGet repo fyi
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 9:48 AM: 
'up-for-grabs' is available in PowerShell repo and is a great way to start.
IISResetMe (Mathias) 9:48 AM: 
PowerShell-RFC maintenance seems a bit stale the last 6-7 months, care to clarify expectations? 
MaxTrinidad 9:48 AM: 
Are we expectign to see the .NET Core 3.0 for the summit?
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:48 AM: 
What is the ship date target for 3.0?
Mullick, Ayan 9:49 AM: 
They haven't yet put the SQLServer PowerShell module on GitHub. They have had it on their to-do for months. How can one get an update.
__https://trello.com/c/4zkQ9ffs/115-open-source-and-put-on-github-powershell-gallery 
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:49 AM: 
RFC's feels like a black hole. Where typed text goes to die...
MaxTrinidad 9:50 AM: 
SQLServer is owned by MIcrosoft SQL Server Team. It would be hard for them to let go! haha :)
Shawn Melton (@wsmelton) 9:52 AM: 
Another large list of community folks streaming are built on this repo https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams
Darwin Sanoy 9:52 AM: 
Is Joey's keyboard on fire yet?
Darwin Sanoy 9:53 AM: 
He's faster than voice recognition
IISResetMe (Mathias) 9:53 AM: 
I've already implemented it :P
Mike O'Neill 9:54 AM: 
because it's VSCode!
Mike O'Neill 9:54 AM: 
happens to me often
Keith Hill 9:54 AM: 
Check AMSI CPU usage. :-)
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:54 AM: 
@Joey JavaScript?
MaxTrinidad 9:54 AM: 
Add memory! LOL
Darwin Sanoy 9:54 AM: 
Might be Markdown plug-ins
Mike O'Neill 9:54 AM: 
seems like a memory issue leak somewhere
Mike O'Neill 9:55 AM: 
reboot 3 times and fixes the issue
Mike O'Neill 9:55 AM: 
:-o
MaxTrinidad 9:55 AM: 
Ah! Defrag your disk!
Darwin Sanoy 9:55 AM: 
I've had it forget what the "Return" key is supposed to do because of markdown plugins
IISResetMe (Mathias) 9:55 AM: 
For context: I'm mostly interested in getting the ball rolling to get formal feedback on features/behavior - which I believe would be easier if the RFC draft was accepted + ID assigned in at least a draft state :) 
Mullick, Ayan 9:56 AM: 
(y) Could you share his email?
Shawn Melton (@wsmelton) 9:57 AM: 
Typing lag in VS Code...could be this one: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/27378
Shawn Melton (@wsmelton) 9:57 AM: 
Disable VS Code from using GPU can also help perf of it (don't know if it will directly for typing)
MaxTrinidad 9:58 AM: 
LOL L)
MaxTrinidad 9:58 AM: 
:)
Knox, Cory 9:59 AM: 
Doesn't he have a waiting reboot? That's probably the performance issue :D
IISResetMe (Mathias) 9:59 AM: 
Cool, thanks Joey!
Shawn Melton (@wsmelton) 10:01 AM: 
Maynot be the call to ask this but saw Tyler mention on Twitter about getting PS Core support in Azure Functions. Is there any word or update on that, or an issue we can follow?
Keith Hill 10:01 AM: 
BTW Bergmeister has done some nice work in VSCode PS extension to support file menu items for Run Pesters Tests and Debug Pester Tests.
Adil Zia 10:02 AM: 
better tab autocomplete in VS with PS extension? Hope...
MaxTrinidad 10:02 AM: 
Save the doc Joey!
Joey Aiello 10:03 AM: 
Max wins
MaxTrinidad 10:03 AM: 
:)
Adil Zia 10:03 AM: 
in the editor as well
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:03 AM: 
vscode autosaves periodically :)
Joey Aiello 10:04 AM: 
Yeah ,but it fixed the perf problem
MaxTrinidad 10:04 AM: 
Any changes to Cloud Shell?
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:04 AM: 
Sorry, Just changed from my phone to pc. What was the link to the Powershell Live site again? (listing people live sharing their codeing)
Joey Aiello 10:04 AM: 
twitch.tv/PowerShellLive 
Keith Hill 10:04 AM: 
Yup, both Run/Debug are in the menu.
Shawn Melton (@wsmelton) 10:04 AM: 
twitch.tv\powershelllive
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:04 AM: 
thanks :)
MaxTrinidad 10:05 AM: 
I'm looking for the upload to a diffrente location
Edwin Young 10:07 AM: 
https://feedback.azure.com/forums/598699-azure-cloud-shell  is the best option to request/update improvements there
MaxTrinidad 10:07 AM: 
I think I aded that feedbakc sometime ago.
Roberth Strand 10:07 AM: 
Would be awesome to check out
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:08 AM: 
the azure functions sounds awsome :) 
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:08 AM: 
dont think so
Roberth Strand 10:08 AM: 
I would like to be on the list ;)
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:08 AM: 
would be great :) 
MaxTrinidad 10:08 AM: 
Any progress on the Textbased datagrid view. :)
Darwin Sanoy 10:09 AM: 
Progress on text editor ? :D
Mullick, Ayan 10:09 AM: 
How can I contact Mateo about the SQLserver module?
Thomas 10:09 AM: 
Any updates on help system leveraging markdown?
Joey Aiello 10:09 AM: 
richturn_ms
Darwin Sanoy 10:09 AM: 
And tar for windows packaging?
Edwin Young 10:09 AM: 
Could Try @matteo_taveggia on twitter also
MaxTrinidad 10:10 AM: 
I got Mateo email. I've been in contact with him about SMO crossplat.
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:10 AM: 
are you talking about reinventing vi in powershell?
Darwin Sanoy 10:10 AM: 
Did you find the internal Microsoft person for tar?
MaxTrinidad 10:10 AM: 
matteot@microsoft.com
Keith Hill 10:10 AM: 
It's in 1809
Mullick, Ayan 10:11 AM: 
Thanks Max
MaxTrinidad 10:11 AM:

Adil Zia 10:11 AM: 
is there a method that reads and or modifies excel and other office files without COM?

especially with the problem of it having to open Excel or the relevant program..and being slow
Adil Zia 10:12 AM: 
theres also the issue to make reports on side vm servers without having to install office .... especially if you want to automate it
Adil Zia 10:12 AM: 
com makes tht dificult
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:13 AM: 
aah 
IISResetMe (Mathias) 10:13 AM: 
Does .NET Core have any primitives for creating tar-balls? GZip is already available, so might make sense to augment Compress/Expand-Archive for tar.gz?
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 10:13 AM: 
(y)
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:13 AM: 
@Adil Check out the Import-Excel module
Keith Hill 10:14 AM: 
So Joey, did you create a vim alias to Git for Windows vim in your profile? :-) Handy, yeah?
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:14 AM: 
Doug Finke wrote it
Knox, Cory 10:14 AM: 
ImportExcel FTW
MaxTrinidad 10:14 AM: 
On Excel.. Still the .Net component is a wrapper to the com object.
Aleksandar 10:14 AM: 
https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWriteExcel/0.0.15
Adil Zia 10:14 AM: 
i thought importexcel uses com
Aleksandar 10:14 AM: 
https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWriteWord/0.5.16
Knox, Cory 10:15 AM: 
importexcel doesn't use COM unless you're converting xls to xlsx
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:15 AM: 
I think ImportExcel uses a .net library that understands the office file formats
Darwin Sanoy 10:15 AM: 
Use the tar code ;)
Adil Zia 10:15 AM: 
Ah i see
Joel Francis 10:15 AM: 
Probability of being able to get binary parsing support approved for 6.2 GA? ;) 
IISResetMe (Mathias) 10:15 AM: 
OpenXML SDK library also supports authoring Office documents (including excel) without any COM service interaction :) 
Joel Francis 10:16 AM: 
Hahaha
Joel Francis 10:16 AM: 
Mostly Ilya's fantastic comments tbh
Joel Francis 10:16 AM: 
Cheers! ️
MaxTrinidad 10:16 AM: 
I'm Old School!! LOL :) OPenXML Rules!
