You aren't able to talk in the call, unfortunately, we're looking at how to fix this with Teams(I'm not seeing a way to mute myself. Are we all auto muted? I got background noise)

So this is what I hate about applying "Agile Discovery" to a well known problem domain like Video Conferencing in a Chat client.  You really don't have to have customers ask you for ever tiny feature.  If 90% of current products have it, it's probably good to put it on the roadmap.

Seems like if you hit "play" before you guys are broadcasting, you have to quit and rejoin to get the stream.

please make sure it works with psexec!

Yeah,the current Test-Connection does a great job of getting the data. It's just hard to use it programmatically in the PowerShell ecosystem.

How is the association of login shell setup scripts scoped?  It's not clear to me how it's any different than starting up pwsh with a profile...  (unless login shells have more profile association/scoping mechanisms than what pwsh profiles currently do)

During the last call there was a question for packaging a script as an application package with all its dependencies... Any idea if this will be supported or if it's on a roadmap at all?

re: releases and such -- are we able to get concurrent releases posted to, for example, chocolatey?

Joel Sallow
currently the delay is up to like a week or so after release for I think Stevie? currently has it maintained on choco

So basically ... no new language features in 7 -- it's officially the "Finally catching up with 5.1" release?

Not liking how new native utilities are only forward-provided (e.g. tar / cur).  Is the new terminal going to be downloadable for other windows distros ;)

Would be good to have the PS team interacting with Windows Terminal team to make sure they're representing PS adequately in the default settings - like blue bg only for PS 5 and dark bg for PS 6/7.  Also, would like to see PS 6/7 use new Cascadia Code font (or at least Consolas) instead of Courier New.

For folks wanting Joey/Steve to move closer to the mic, note that moving your mousewheel down while hovering over the screen share will turn down the volume, which may explain why you'd like them to move closer to the mic. ;)

re: internal module pipeline -- is there any internal efforts at consistency of MS-designed module quality? Sharepoint PNP is a good example of how it can be great, and there are quite a lot of modules across the board that are... much less nice to work with, unfortunately.  :/

@Jakul The Windows terminal still has some  shared components with conhost.exe, therefore if improvements are made in this area, they will also reach downlevel.

Joel Sallow
Good to know Kirk, ty! I'm thinking it would be great to reframe the formatting subsystem so that we ditch the whole "formatting objects" idea and move the data to ETS properties or something, such that piping objects to Format-Table etc doesn't actually chew up the useful data and instead just applies an ETS property that the eventual formatter works with to render the data appropriately

Anonymous
Any documentation for gotchas on moving from AZ PS function v1 to v2?

Joel Sallow
That way you can safely use Format-Table etc to actually DEFINE the format for your function's output without destroying downstream cmdlets' ability to use the data
