Constantin Hager 9:29 AM:

yes
Mike Lombardi 9:31 AM:

Blow it away and rebuild with DSC. ;)
Justino Garcia 9:31 AM:
Can we add --help support for pwsh

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:31 AM:
Please open an issue!
Mike Lombardi 9:31 AM:

I had a packer + vagrant box for my work machine at $LastJob, since I couldn’t get permissions to pave over my actual desktop workstation
Justino Garcia 9:32 AM:
mike that crazy

Mark Kraus 9:32 AM:

@Justino there is an open issue here https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6397
Mark Kraus 9:32 AM:

got vote/comment
Justino Garcia 9:32 AM:
Thanks mark

Mike Lombardi 9:32 AM:

@MarkKraus++
Mike Lombardi 9:33 AM:

“You want to install _what_ on your workstation?"
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:33 AM:
#6397 is about cmdlets, I think the ask is for pwsh
Thomas Rayner 9:33 AM:
What's the usual turnaround on call end -> recording posted? I'm keen to hear about the Script Analyzer point, but I gotta run in about 20 min to another meeting.

Joey Aiello 9:33 AM:
I'll get it up this week for you, Thomas

Thomas Rayner 9:33 AM:

Justino Garcia 9:36 AM:
In linux, obviously --help (or -h) or -? as a way to get help

Justino Garcia 9:37 AM:
Okay I see np

Tobias 9:38 AM:

#requieres Would solve -- problem
Mike Lombardi 9:38 AM:

Just to clarify, we only see VSCode Joey, all your other screens when shown are blank boxes which is probably on purpose.
Mike Lombardi 9:38 AM:

(y)
Tobias 9:38 AM:

you can specify the powershell version by #reuires at the beginning of your script, so you could prevent breaking existing stuff.
Mike Lombardi 9:39 AM:

Well, but changing the pwsh switches can break people like puppet/chef/other things that are calling PowerShell
Darwin Sanoy 9:39 AM:
#requires is also opt-in by default - so hurts until you do that - or am I misunderstanding?

Sean Wheeler 9:46 AM:
@Joey - I want to talk about our release branch in Docs

Joey Aiello 9:47 AM:
Got it! (yes)

Mike Lombardi 9:47 AM:

Ping on PowerShellGet, NuGet versioning, and OneGet generally. Specifically, any plans to move towards NuGet 3+ support, and timeline for that work / priority?
Thomas Rayner 9:47 AM:
You could have used -NotReadyForPrimetime and people would have still got the message

Bill 9:49 AM:

Using a version scheme that the Version type doesn&apos;t understand would not be great. 
Stankiewicz, Michael (EUT & BTO) 9:51 AM:

Travis Plunk 9:52 AM:
$a=[System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion]::new('6.1.1') 

$b=[System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion]::new('6.1.1-p') 

> $a -lt $b 
False

$a -gt $b 
True
Mark Kraus 9:54 AM:

IMO.. this should come from CoreFX (not pwsh) and there is an open issue to impliment semver types. https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/13526
Thomas Rayner 9:55 AM:
Gotta run but looking forward to the recording. See you guys next time!

Justino Garcia 9:55 AM:
corefx

Stankiewicz, Michael (EUT & BTO) 9:56 AM:

Mark Kraus 10:01 AM:

hrm.. can we require that "add in 6.4"?
Joey Aiello 10:01 AM:
We can, yeah

Joey Aiello 10:01 AM:
I think it would be useful

Mark Kraus 10:01 AM:

as in.. required in the doc commits
Mark Kraus 10:02 AM:

Yes.. there is interest
Mike Lombardi 10:02 AM:

Generally, transparency/availability is ++
Darwin Sanoy 10:03 AM:
I think you should have at least some meetings that are closed door for the reasons you mention

Mike Lombardi 10:03 AM:

Transcripts with redactions are probably a good intermediate step
Mike Lombardi 10:04 AM:

Then you can verify how much you actually need o redact
Simon Wåhlin 10:04 AM:
Agree! For a listenonly, a recording would be preferred to overcome timezone problem
Darwin Sanoy 10:04 AM:
redactions take time and isn't the team struggling with keeping up with project information outputs?

Mike Lombardi 10:04 AM:

Good point
Justino Garcia 10:04 AM:
hire a admin to work on this

Darwin Sanoy 10:05 AM:
how would an admin know what should be redacted?

Justino Garcia 10:06 AM:
good point

Mike Lombardi 10:10 AM:

(y)
Tobias 10:17 AM:

Because we&apos;re talking about msi&apos;s right now, can you pleas simplify creating msi and msp files?
Joey Aiello 10:17 AM:
For PowerShell Core specifically, or in general?

Darwin Sanoy 10:17 AM:
@tobias that is WIX

Tobias 10:18 AM:

in general
Joey Aiello 10:18 AM:
I think this is where they're going: https://github.com/Microsoft/msix-packaging

Jeff Dean 10:19 AM:
Thanks Joey! Thanks for that link. MSIs are the bane of my existence.

Travis Plunk 10:20 AM:
@Jeff Agreed
Kexy Biscuit 10:21 AM:
What about curl & curl.exe

Darwin Sanoy 10:21 AM:
Nice

Nicholas M. Getchell 10:21 AM:
Thanks for listening to the community on SSH Joey

Mike Lombardi 10:26 AM:

Mike Lombardi 10:28 AM:

The code is SO. MUCH. PRETTIER.
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:29 AM:
Maybe talk about it offline but: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3169#issuecomment-372869168

Mike Lombardi 10:29 AM:

That already breaks with if/else
Mike Lombardi 10:29 AM:

Darwin Sanoy 10:29 AM:
Can msix-packaging just go into nuget 4 ?

Jim Truher 10:30 AM:
Get-process |
Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:30 AM:
The question is: What are the opinions about the parser going forward?

Joey Aiello 10:30 AM:
Do you know anyone on the Nuget or MSIX teams, Darwin?

Joey Aiello 10:30 AM:
@Christoph: that's a big one for me, I'm not caught up on that thread

Jim Truher 10:30 AM:

Bergmeister, Christoph (Reigate) 10:30 AM:
(y)

Joey Aiello 10:30 AM:
Let me talk to Rob and get back to you on the next call?

Darwin Sanoy 10:30 AM:
No I don't.  Seems like yet another standard and something that requires runtime installs?

Darwin Sanoy 10:31 AM:
...requires runtimes to process when I probably already have nuget?

Joey Aiello 10:31 AM:
I'm not up to date there, I just saw the announcement

Joey Aiello 10:31 AM:
I'll back channel and see if I can get you in touch with someone

Mike Lombardi 10:32 AM:

Like I said, not important. :)
