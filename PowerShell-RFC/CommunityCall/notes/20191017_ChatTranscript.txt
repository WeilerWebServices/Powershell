I am interested in knowing a "synopsis" of issues with $? - specifically $?.  I know most, if not all, of the error issue saga; but nothing specific about $?.

Anybody checking the chat window ?
Cant see anything published

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
yes, not getting to Q&A yet(prasoon asked "Anybody checking the chat window ?

Michael B.
so, on windows, is this dependent on the new windows shell?

Speaking of $?, will && || operators make it into the next preview?

Joel Sallow
The main issue with $? at the moment is that anything you wrap in `()` parentheses leaves `$?` with `$true` in all circumstances immediately after the parentheses

Thanks Joel! This is the one I was referring to with assymetric behavior with regards to $?(Joel Sallow asked "$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError($errorRecord)")

No, just Windows 10 after...RS3? I believe?(Michael B. asked "so, on windows, is this dependent on the new windows shell?")

How many more Previews before v7 goes GA?

Joel Sallow
so with (<command>) && <action> -- even if <command> fails, it still executes <action>. It's fine if that's different from `<command> && <action>` but it limits the effectiveness of && or ||

Michael B.
thanks!

Two! Then RC in December to align with .NET Core 3.1 GA, then hopefully GA in January(Ryan  asked "How many more Previews before v7 goes GA?")

Does .NET Core 3.1 bring anything new or interesting?

Joel Sallow
i.e., it also prevents more complex expressions e.g., `(<command> && <command>) || <action>`

Joel Sallow
just for clarity on the main present issue with $? that I'm aware of :)

May I ask how @Steve_MSFT create those preview gifs?

we should *totally* wait for 7.1 as the LTS since it'd line up nicely with 5.1 ;)

Giphy is also a good tool to use for that kind of thing. THere are a few screencap tools around there that can go direct to gif :)

Will using named pipes in WinComp module solve the issue which cause due to CVE 2019-0543

Windows also has built-in recording (if not disabled by GPO) Win-G (Xbox game bar allows recording)

My bad I ran maintenance XD

Does that include your Azure pipelines for building PowerShell. If not could a change to the telemetry sent be added to see how much of this use is in those ToolSets?

They have pwsh in preview in Azure DevOps. I have to use that for New-AzResourceGroupDeployment

@Sean - Will this be easily linked to from the main landing page for the PowerShell Docs ? 
I ask as there are still orgs using 3/4/5 and need to reference those docs easily

Get-Acl is amazingly expensive. Regardless, I think this makes good sense on Unix-type platforms.

Keith Hill
Experimental feature then in preview.5?

Joel Sallow
If the P/invoke is incurred mainly in the formatter and when querying those properties directly, I think it'd be useful to have that available across the board, including on windows

Ryan 
@Jim - My thoughts on this is have it as a Switch on GCI that we can add as a $PSDefaultParameter 

Keith Hill
@jtruher - will the *nix stat info be an experimental features in preview.5/6?
