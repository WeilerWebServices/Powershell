Trevor Sullivan 9:31 AM: 
What happened to the attendee list in Skype for Business?
Trevor Sullivan 9:32 AM: 
Oh there's a different tab now.
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 9:32 AM: 
@Trevor ?
Edwin Young 9:32 AM: 
all looks ok here
Trevor Sullivan 9:32 AM: 
Mac version of S4B changed
Trevor Sullivan 9:33 AM: 
AWS Lambda supports PowerShell Core now :)
Friedrich Weinmann 9:33 AM: 
The string cmdlet RFC
Joel Bennett 9:34 AM: 
working for me
Edin Zbanic 9:34 AM: 
Yes
Trevor Sullivan 9:34 AM: 
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-lambda-support-for-powershell-core/
Keith Hill 9:34 AM: 
yes
Ackerman, Sean 9:34 AM: 
yes
Friedrich Weinmann 9:34 AM: 
see just fine :)
Friedrich Weinmann 9:35 AM: 
yes
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:35 AM: 
The RFC is bigger in scope than Join-String
Trevor Sullivan 9:35 AM: 
I know there's been some asks about PowerShell Core on Amazon Linux ... is there still a blocker on that?
Ackerman, Sean 9:36 AM: 
yes
Anderson, Drew 9:36 AM: 
yes
Keith Hill 9:37 AM: 
no
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 9:38 AM: 
ðŸ‘‹
Ackerman, Sean 9:38 AM: 
yep
Darwin Sanoy 9:39 AM: 
install-powershell.sh should be able to install on Amazon Linux
Trevor Sullivan 9:39 AM: 
Upgrade to 6.1 went smoothly. Also updated the Homebrew for Mac package.
Keith Hill 9:39 AM: 
Which list is smaller? Modules that work w/6.1 or those that don't?
Trevor Sullivan 9:39 AM: 
Cool, thanks Darwin.
Trevor Sullivan 9:40 AM: 
I'm unfortunately not tied in with regular development of PowerShell Core ... do we have any unit tests around chunked HTTP responses? I know this is rather nuanced, but ran into it last night. https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7824
Ryan Yates 9:45 AM: 
docathons for hacktoberfest???
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:45 AM: 
(y)
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 9:46 AM: 
yesss
Trevor Sullivan 9:46 AM: 
Good job, Mark!
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:46 AM: 
What! That's silly1
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 9:46 AM: 
Mark is the true PowerShell Standard ;)
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:48 AM: 
Can we add some templates for help? Or does it already exist?
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:48 AM: 
Sure, but I was asked to write the docs for join-string...
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:49 AM: 
:D
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 9:50 AM: 
Out-Gridview alternatives!! :)
Friedrich Weinmann 9:51 AM: 
Enumerations?
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 9:51 AM: 
Updated SDK!!
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:52 AM: 
Even more promising is looking at derived PSObjects.
Edwin Young 9:54 AM: 
If you're going to Ignite 2018 this is a handy primer on the powershell content. https://cda.ms/FR 
Michael Lombardi 9:54 AM: 
\o/
Staffan (PowerCode) 9:55 AM: 
Can you gauge the quality of all these in some way? Are they tested?
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 9:56 AM: 
Cool!!
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 9:58 AM: 
S 2019 with DSC v1.0, ??, isn't it the same as LCM version ?
if so t should be 2.0
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 10:00 AM: 
Can it support SQL Server backend on Linux? :P
Joel Bennett 10:00 AM: 
publishing
Edwin Young 10:01 AM: 
you need 1.6.7+ to publish to new gallery 
Friedrich Weinmann 10:01 AM: 
not really for me
Edwin Young 10:01 AM: 
not 2.0.0
Keith Hill 10:02 AM: 
Yes, very highly desired feature!
Friedrich Weinmann 10:02 AM: 
Been fixing that for years with:
$PSDefaultParameterValue
Will not have any impact whatsoever for me :)
Joel Bennett 10:02 AM: 
The major feature in 2.0 is that it falls back to user scope installs automatically when run not-elevated
Joel Bennett 10:03 AM: 
It's not a HUGE breaking change
Joel Bennett 10:03 AM: 
But it's a change.
Joel Bennett 10:03 AM: 
In fact, maybe it's not a "breaking" change?
Keith Hill 10:03 AM: 
Yeah, the pkgmgnt/psget update process is a bit of a pain.
Brandon Lundt 10:03 AM: 
Whatever it would break would be worth it to me.
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 10:04 AM: 
Agree with @joel, its not hug, but adds lots of benfit
Joel Bennett 10:04 AM: 
The only way it affects CI is if someone is *testing* the fact that it fails?
Ryan Yates 10:04 AM: 
Personally I would like to see it in there in a servicing release as ideally I would have liked to see it in the 6.1 release
Darwin Sanoy 10:04 AM: 
Any status on an official MS Chocolatey feed?
Keith Hill 10:04 AM: 
If admin I thought it used global scope?
Keith Hill 10:05 AM: 
Ah, perhaps that was on Windows PS.
Joel Bennett 10:06 AM: 
Yeah, Keith, that's what I thought ;-)
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:06 AM: 
Related: will Install-Module be fixed? So that -Force will work without the -SkipPublisher -AllowClobber -AcceptLicense -AllowPrerelease madness?
Ryan Yates 10:06 AM: 
but it needs to be in an Admin shell no
Joey Aiello 10:07 AM: 
@Ryan: yes
Joel Bennett 10:07 AM: 
@Staffan: not really
Darwin Sanoy 10:07 AM: 
How about a new switch "-JustDoItDammit"
Ryan Yates 10:07 AM: 
No more switches like ^^
Brandon Lundt 10:07 AM: 
-SrslyYesPlease ?
Keith Hill 10:08 AM: 
How about a "-DoItDamnIt" param?
Ryan Yates 10:08 AM: 
No more switches like ^^ please
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:08 AM: 
-Force should, according do JS, mean 'Just F*$#ing do it'
Joel Bennett 10:09 AM: 
To note taker, correction: "in PS Core it defaults to `CurrentUser` irrespective of whether you're ELEVATED"
Keith Hill 10:09 AM: 
At the very least, it should exclude the clobber warnings on installing/updating the built-in pckgmngt/psget modules.
Joey Aiello 10:09 AM: 
@Keith: THAT we can fix. we need to ship hardcoded PSGet manifests in the "inbox" modules for PS Core
Keith Hill 10:10 AM: 
+1
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 10:10 AM: 
+1
Friedrich Weinmann 10:10 AM: 
I use -Force -SkipPublisherCheck on each dependency install on Azure DevOps. Always.
Keith Hill 10:11 AM: 
You want it to behave more like npm install?
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 10:11 AM: 
It creates dups modules. Update doesn't work.
Ryan Yates 10:11 AM: 
it *SHOULD* if the dependency chain is correctly understood in the module manifest
Ryan Yates 10:12 AM: 
but in PSGet its isnt
Keith Hill 10:12 AM: 
Oh but without the constant (npm) pkg cache corruption issues :-)
Friedrich Weinmann 10:12 AM: 
'-Ensure'? I want 'Ensure' as approved Verb ;)
Felix Becker 10:12 AM: 
Question: Does PowerShellGet support dependencies? I.e. can I declare dependencies on other modules in a module manifest, and have powershellget install them all?
Ryan Yates 10:12 AM: 
@felix look at AzureRM module
Edwin Young 10:12 AM: 
@felix, yes\
Ryan Yates 10:12 AM: 
that shows dependancies
Ryan Yates 10:13 AM: 
but one problem is downloading AzureRM.Profile for each dependant module in the chain of AzureRM module
Ryan Yates 10:14 AM: 
or did when I looked into this ages ago
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:14 AM: 
I use that a lot, but it breaks down if different module need different versions of a dependent module.
Friedrich Weinmann 10:14 AM: 
RequiredVersion is a pest
Edwin Young 10:14 AM: 
@ryan, we should only download a dependency once
Joey Aiello 10:14 AM: 
@Staffan: ^ that's what I was trying to say, just can't articulate the specifics
Felix Becker 10:16 AM: 
Iâ€™m spoiled by node/npm
Ryan Yates 10:16 AM: 
Why a new repo?
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:16 AM: 
node/npm has a nice hybrid model of local & global dependencies/modules/utilities
Ryan Yates 10:17 AM: 
Is this for the choco package of pscore on the community feed? or wider that just PSCore
Joel Bennett 10:17 AM: 
@Staffan: yeah, so Install-Module fail in that instance, but Import-Module might not (if it's not a binary module)? Guess that dependencies need to be handled with -Force ðŸ˜£
Darwin Sanoy 10:18 AM: 
Will source install binaries always be embedded in Microsoft Chocolatey packages?
Darwin Sanoy 10:18 AM: 
That would rock for curation.
Ryan Yates 10:18 AM: 
That makes more sense. I think that was what I was missing elsewhere
Darwin Sanoy 10:18 AM: 
I've chocolatey packages SQL server - so size isn't a challenge.
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:20 AM: 
For the Join-String cmdlet, I think the only outstanding issue is whether it should support wildcards on properties to join.
I.E. 
get-childitem | Join-String *Time*

I haven't implemented it yet, as Iâ€™m not convinced of the usefulness of it. It adds complexity and Iâ€™m not convinced it is worth it.

Is it valuable? If so when? 
Seems like it would need a different delimiter between properties (as opposed to between records)
Ryan Yates 10:20 AM: 
That makes more sense. I think that was what I was missing elsewhere and would do you think it likely would include things like VSCode VSEnterprise installers etc?
Joey Aiello 10:21 AM: 
@Ryan: that's the idea, yes, but it's unclear as to whether it's feasible yet
Friedrich Weinmann 10:23 AM: 
a pleasure
Staffan (PowerCode) 10:24 AM: 
I was thinking conceptual complexity more than implementation
Darwin Sanoy 10:24 AM: 
FYI - unless it has been fixed, chocolatey packages that wrap .MSU's can't run over remoting.  FYI - .NET runtime EXE installers do this.
Darwin Sanoy 10:24 AM: 
It is an .MSU over remoting problem - not chocolatey
Felix Becker 10:26 AM: 
If I have a question, can I just take over audio?
Joey Aiello 10:27 AM: 
stevel-msft and travisez123
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 10:29 AM: 
There are a bunch of Resolution-Duplicate issues to be closed.
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 10:30 AM: 
basically Resolution-* issues
Ryan Yates 10:31 AM: 
RE stalebot
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:31 AM: 
+1 :)
Ackerman, Sean 10:31 AM: 
yeah have a whole team going
Friedrich Weinmann 10:31 AM: 
:'(

Prasoon(kvprasoon) 10:32 AM: 
not f0r ignite,
any for psconf.asia ?
Ryan Yates 10:32 AM: 
I'm not really a fan on it as it can hide long running issues like 1979
Friedrich Weinmann 10:32 AM: 
Will be at PSConfAsia
Ryan Yates 10:32 AM: 
Issue 1979 that is
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 10:32 AM: 
Woohoo! Me
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 10:33 AM: 
$Thankyou all !!!!
MaxTrinidad(PSMVP) 10:33 AM: 
Thanks Everyone!! Bye!!
