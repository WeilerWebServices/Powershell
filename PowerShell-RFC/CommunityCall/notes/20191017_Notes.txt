## Notes

* Preview releases
    * Recently released preview.4 with ternary operator and -ErrorAction Break
    * Holding preview.5 by ~1 week to move to .NET Core 3.1
        * Includes new ErrorView and Get-Error
        * Also adding new `$OutputPreference` variable to turn off VT100
    * WinPS wrapper coming in preview.6
        * Calls out to Windows PS for incompatible modules (like IISAdministration)
        * Using IPC/named pipes instead of implicit remoting in WindowsCompatibility module
    * Please help us out by validating preview releases!
* PowerShell 7 GA
    * Two more preview in Oct and Nov
    * Then RC in December to align with .NET Core 3.1 GA
    * And GA (hopefully!) in January
* Number of open PRs and RFCs that will likely not make it into 7.0
* What does .NET Core 3.1 bring us?
    * Mostly (for us) is that it's an LTS release that's supported for ~3 years
* How does Steve record GIFs?
    * macOS has built in screen record support, then he uses an online tool to convert MOV->GIF
    * Sean uses Screen2Gif for recording
