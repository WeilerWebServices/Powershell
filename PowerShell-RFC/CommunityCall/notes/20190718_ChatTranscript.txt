Yes

Ayan Mullick
Will the 'Foerach -Parallel' feature be available in PowerShell 7 ?

DarwinJS
The US Patent process leans a lot on sales of Patent Pending products for juding patent worthiness - so a similar pattern to what you are proposing.

Barring rejection of the RFC, that's our current plan, yes(Ayan Mullick asked "Will the 'Foerach -Parallel' feature be available in PowerShell 7 ?")

Any voting for the Experimental Features to be implemented?

Comment: Making VSCode Debug Experience Stable since it is now the official "default" editor *is* a feature :)

Any future for VS code running on Ipads for travel needs? Is it on a road map?

Upvote this!(Eric asked "Any future for VS code running on Ipads for travel needs? Is it on a road map?")

Maybe look at coder.com in the meantime which supports the PowerShell extension.

The vscode team is working on a similar thing to coder.com but that's not ready yet(Eric asked "Any future for VS code running on Ipads for travel needs? Is it on a road map?")

Any roadmap for Cloud Shell?

Regarding the RFC Process, this currently feels like theres some holes with the template - can you review / add Comments in Issue 211 / PR 212

Ayan Mullick
Is it feasible to make circuit PowerShell like AdaFruit's CircuitPython for working on IoT?

Hi, what about adding ^ operator, like 2^2 = 4; or 2**2, whatever )

If the module does not adhere to NuGet version normalization nuget.exe will create a version mismatch between the package and psd1 version. PowerShellGet uses the package version number to create the module version folder not psd1. This causes Import-Module to throw an error.

If you haven't already, check out https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-IoT(Ayan Mullick asked "Is it feasible to make circuit PowerShell like AdaFruit's CircuitPython for working on IoT?")

You could run code on the circuit board directly from the IDE without having to compile it first.

^ operator is being used in C# for their Index/Range types that are coming up. Not sure it's a great idea to go against that ourselves.
