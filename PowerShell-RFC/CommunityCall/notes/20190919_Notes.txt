## Notes

* Releases
    * 7.0.0-preview.4 out later today, blogpost to come with GIFs on features
    * Working towards ~December Release Candidate, ~January General Availability
    * Bound to .NET Core 3.1 and their dates
        * Will get LTS support for 7.0 and .NET Core 3.1
    * PowerShell Script Analyzer 1.18.3 released with a critical bugfix (get it from the Gallery!)
* RFCs
    * Going through an exercise of rewriting our processes and principles around PowerShell and RFCs
    * Want to provide more transparency and dependability, but also the Committee is an executive body that sometimes has to make unpopular decisions
    * "We want to be sure we don't preclude behavior when we add behavior." - Jim
* PowerShellGet 3.0
    * We want to make sure that new modules are well-tested and used in production
      before they ship into PowerShell
    * PSGet 3.0 will be in preview in 7.0 GA, and will not make it's way into PS until 7.x
* Some PS Team owned cmdlets are missing in PS Core vs. Windows PS
    * We cannot legally use private/undocumented Windows APIs from PowerShell as it ships outside of Windows*
    * Some "work just fine" when sideloading inbox Windows modules (like `Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts`),
      but others cannot be imported because they have the same name as existing PS Core modules
      * For these, use the `WindowsCompatibility` module to call into them via Windows PowerShell
* DSC
    * `Invoke-DscResource` being made available cross-platform in 7.0
    * Not calling through a Local Configuration Manager (LCM),
      but invoking directly in user context via PowerShell
    * `Configuration` blocks now compile correctly on macOS as well
    * Still some bugs/kinks that need to be documented, but it's a good start
* 3.0, 4.0, and 5.1 documentation is being maintained on `PowerShell-Docs` and `windows-powershell-docs` repos,
  but hasn't been finding it's way into updateable help
  * Sean has a blog post on platyPS and using the Markdown source in the docs repo
    to manually update your console help on downlevel versions
  * Currently in the process of archiving (read-only) the 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 help
    (5.1 will continue to be maintained)
* PS Conference Asia
* Demos
    * `ForEach-Object -Parallel` is awesome, check out the demo and Paul's blog post
* Go through GitHub Issues
* Q&A
    * Conditional chain operator (`&&` and `||`) going to make it in time for PS7?
        * Would like to make this into 7.0-preview.5 as experimental
    * Is PS Conf Asia being streamed online?
        * We don't believe so, but there will likely be recordings
    * When does 6.2 support end?
        * 6 months after 7.0 GAs, roughly July of next year
    * Is this being recorded?
        * Yes, we record all Community Calls and put them on YouTube,
          easy to find at https://aka.ms/PSCommunityCall
    * `@@` "generalized splatting" will likely not make it for PS 7.0,
      no one from our team is working on that
    * Is Dispose() work being done?
        * Joel Sallow needs us to finish his RFC before he can finish code
