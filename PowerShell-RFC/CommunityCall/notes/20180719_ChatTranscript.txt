DarwinJS 9:46 AM: 
Preview 2 was the last one to be an automatic upgrade in what is now the "stable" distribution right?
Jeremy Murrah 9:46 AM: 
apt list install from ubuntu gives version 6.1.0 preview 2
DarwinJS 9:48 AM: 
yep
Maximo Trinidad 9:48 AM: 
sneaky!!
DarwinJS 9:48 AM: 
Truth will be known on next prod GA
Michael T Lombardi 9:49 AM: 
sounds similar to a nixos package
DarwinJS 9:49 AM: 
That's not .MSIX ?
Aleksandar Nikolic 9:50 AM: 
Are there any plans to offer some Azure Linux VM images with preinstalled PS Core?
DarwinJS 9:51 AM: 
Amazon has that!
DarwinJS 9:51 AM: 
Amazon Linux 2 has an AMI with .NET Core and PowerShell
DarwinJS 9:52 AM: 
It isn't there default AMI - but my team will be talking to them this month and I want to push on that.
DarwinJS 9:53 AM: 
Seperate AMI yes
DarwinJS 9:53 AM: 
Ah ok
DarwinJS 9:53 AM: 
MSIX is technically linux too.
Michael T Lombardi 9:53 AM: 
Ping for later: Any further news on DSC Core?

Nichols, Colin 9:56 AM: 
general powershell update question (when you get a moment), is there any mechanism to check for new releases within pwsh (like update-help), maybe something like update-pwsh?
Prasoon(kvprasoon) 9:58 AM: 
(y) My vote for Update-Pwsh 
Adam Dzyacky 9:59 AM: 
i have a small ISE switching blocker, but it's not really a PowerShell team thing. The area is around the Azure Automation/SMA runbook management tool in ISE. What's the best way to interact with whatever team is responsible for that?
Adam Dzyacky 9:59 AM: 
otherwise, VS Code all the way. Great work!
Travis Plunk 9:59 AM: 
Snap package pages are at:
https://snapcraft.io/powershell  and https://snapcraft.io/powershell-preview
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:00 AM: 
@Adam AFAIK, the Azure Automation extension for the ISE also can work in VSCode‚Ä¶ let me see if I can find the link
Aleksandar Nikolic 10:00 AM: 
You need to build it by yourself
Aleksandar Nikolic 10:01 AM: 
It's easier to use it in ISE :(

https://github.com/azureautomation/azure-automation-ise-addon#from-source

Look for If you want to build the standalone AddOn for use with Visual Studio or VSCode
Stankiewicz, Michael (EUT & BTO) 10:01 AM: 
can you please send a link to the CVE representing the VSCode posh extension vulnerability?
Aleksandar Nikolic 10:01 AM: 
In Code it runs as a standalone add-on

Adam Dzyacky 10:02 AM: 
that is interesting. wow, this is fantastic. most excellent @tyler thank you!
Stankiewicz, Michael (EUT & BTO) 10:02 AM: 
@Tyler Thanks!
Nichols, Colin 10:02 AM: 
Thanks for the comments.
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:03 AM: 
No problem @Adam! 

@Aleksandar I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs responsible for that addon but I‚Äôll try to find them to figure out how to properly release that so you don‚Äôt need to build from source
Aleksandar Nikolic 10:04 AM: 
Eamon O'Reilly
Aleksandar Nikolic 10:04 AM: 
Eamon owns it
Adam Dzyacky 10:04 AM: 
at least i know where it is, if i need to build or help push that forward i eagerly would
Aleksandar Nikolic 10:05 AM: 
Building it from a source is a blocker for the ITPros
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:06 AM: 
@Adam it doesn‚Äôt look like there isn‚Äôt an issue on github for a release that supports vscode‚Ä¶ could you open one? That will help with that effort a lot
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:08 AM: 
it‚Äôs much better if a community member opens an issue
Adam Dzyacky 10:08 AM: 
sure thing
Stankiewicz, Michael (EUT & BTO) 10:08 AM: 
Have there been any updates to the documentation that Steve Lee was working on in regards to the PowerShell Core compatibility pack story?  This is a confusing topic and one that Steve was going to provide a formal doc on to demystify this for the masses.
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:09 AM: 
Thanks Adam!
Michael T Lombardi 10:09 AM: 
If you write plain text that changes the state of things in production, that's development. :)
