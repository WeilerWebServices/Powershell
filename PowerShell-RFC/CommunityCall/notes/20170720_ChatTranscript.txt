The blog post says you are using .NET Standard 2.0. Is that really true? I thought you were actually targeting NetCoreApp2.0 / net4xx?
Sullivan, Trevor 9:37 AM: 
I always install the latest beta as soon as it's available. :) Keeps getting better.
Keith Hill 9:37 AM: 
Are you sharing?

I don't see anything sharing.

Any news around dependency management going forward?
Darwin Sanoy 9:46 AM: 
Ok it's actually LuaBugLight by Aaron Margosis.  I don't mean that the tool code could be reused - but the concept: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/aaron_margosis/2015/06/30/lua-buglight-2-3-with-support-for-windows-8-1-and-windows-10/ 
Glenn Sarti 9:46 AM: 
Not sure if this is RFC worthy....is there any way to a "registry" of installed PS versions on a host. Give we can install PS6 pretty much anywhere, how could we discover where PS is installed on the filesystem (and potentially version)

One thing I'd love some team / community help on ... writing native cmdlets for Mac OS X and Linux. Some examples of how to call native libraries would be awesome.

Glenn Sarti 9:49 AM: 
Does PS _have_ to be installed there is it just default?
Devin 9:49 AM: 
Seems like having env variable aware .net targetting and stuff might be best in an IDE
Devin 9:50 AM: 
but w/e
Joel Bennett 9:50 AM: 
Can we talk about the plan for ACTUALLY supporting .Net Standard 2 for nuget packages?
Darwin Sanoy 9:51 AM: 
I'd vote environment variable too because it would work multiplatform
Keith Hill 9:55 AM: 
Dumb question - can&apos;t PS just use nuget.exe to resolve nuget dependencies?
Keith Hill 9:55 AM: 
Hehe - that was me Joel. PSake required VSSetup on Windows but not needed on Linux/macOS.
Devin 9:59 AM: 
So would this be a requires that can target OS?
Devin 9:59 AM: 
and exclude OS
Devin 9:59 AM: 
?
Joel Bennett 9:59 AM: 
yes please ;-)
Darwin Sanoy 10:00 AM: 
This conversation is being had in the Chocolatey community as well.
Simon Wåhlin 10:00 AM: 
Sounds like something along the line of what Warren Frame is doing in PSDepend doesnt it?
Jeff Dean 10:00 AM: 
Not really related to dependencies, but does Core already support Desired State Configuration declarative 'function' types?
Darwin Sanoy 10:00 AM: 
Richer dependency and requirements declaration in .nuspec
Keith Hill 10:02 AM: 
@Trevor - isn&apos;t that a .NET Core platform invoke call to a native shared lib?
Keith Hill 10:02 AM: 
So sprinkle in some C# code with a pinvoke call.
Sullivan, Trevor 10:02 AM: 
@Keith: Possibly, yeah. I just am not familiar with native libraries on non-Windows platforms.
Keith Hill 10:02 AM: 
It&apos;s not that hard.
Keith Hill 10:03 AM: 
Example:
[DllImport("libc")]
static extern int read(int handle, byte[] buf, int n);

@Keith: nice. I think the big things is needing docs for native libs.
Keith Hill 10:05 AM: 
Yup.
Glenn Sarti 10:05 AM: 
Joey: thanks for that. More thinking to do.
Joel Bennett 10:06 AM: 
It will depend how much you break
Glenn Sarti 10:06 AM: 
hahah...yeah right

I think that is the Core expectation? Correct?

--self-contained. :-)

Hopping off the call. Cheers for the help, guys!
Darwin Sanoy 10:13 AM: 
powershell-core is on chocolatey - but does not show up due to being marked beta
Darwin Sanoy 10:14 AM: 
If we can decide an environment variable pointer name for "current version of core" I can add it to the chocolatey package
Darwin Sanoy 10:15 AM: 
This variable would be helpful for making powershell core the default CLI for openssh
Bobby Cannon 10:17 AM: 
I haven&apos;t done any research on this but since you guys are talking about it. I create a custom application that is a PowerShell host / terminal. Would I want to host PowerShell 6 in process or find PowerShell in the environment and communicate with it via PowerShell Editor Services?
Joel Bennett 10:18 AM: 
What they just told me is that right now the only way is to host PS6 and ship all of it with your host app.
Jeff Dean 10:18 AM: 
correct
Bobby Cannon 10:19 AM: 
ok, sounds good. Core is new, can I host 6 in .NET 4.6.2?
Bobby Cannon 10:19 AM: 
new to me that is...
Jeff Dean 10:19 AM: 
that leads to the question... will the LCM eventually support PS core 6?
Jeff Dean 10:21 AM:

Keith Hill 10:28 AM: 
Looking through gh/ps/docs and not finding a doc on creating a cross-platform binary module? Anyone have a link to such a doc? Or is the host-powershell.md the doc?
Keith Hill 10:29 AM: 
k, just wondering when to start messing with this - after having been burned by net core 1.0 alphas :-)
Keith Hill 10:29 AM: 
Does seem to be firming up. New msbuild rocks.
