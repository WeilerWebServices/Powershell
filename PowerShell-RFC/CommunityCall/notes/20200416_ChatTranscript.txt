Yay on improving the shell - particulary invoking native commands!  The shell experience really is the "on-ramp" to PowerShell IMO.

Is there any plans to improve the intellisense speeds when using the script editor pane of VSCode with the PowerShell extension? I feel very often that i'm typing away a cmd expecting to hit - and tab through the options available but actually just end up with an actual tab spacer on screen.

platyPS: will the dependency on YamlDotNet persist in v2? It's been a pain for us in our module build pipes where we generate md from comment based help

It's a pain as other modules also have this dependency but different version(Ben Gelens asked "platyPS: will the dependency on YamlDotNet persist in v2? It's been a pain for us in our module build pipes where we generate md from comment based help")

Please file an issue with more details. We do need to handle Yaml front matter and generate Yaml content for the parameters.(Ben Gelens asked "platyPS: will the dependency on YamlDotNet persist in v2? It's been a pain for us in our module build pipes where we generate md from comment based help")

As part of working better with "native commands", could we get support for dot sourcing bat/cmd files and have the env var changes pulled into the PS session?  This is really important for C++ devs who need to configure their PS session with VC env vars (typically need to run vcvarsall.bat).

I think we've (me and Jim) contemplated dot-sourcing env vars upwards out of processes, but it's not straightforward. 

Other shells can do it because dot-sourcing just runs the script in-process, but running a script in a different language gets trickier.

We'd need to do some investigation.(Keith Hill asked "As part of working better with "native commands", could we get support for dot sourcing bat/cmd files and have the env var changes pulled into the PS session?

We have community solutions for this like `Invoke-BatchFile` dating back to a demo Lee wrote years ago.

Yeah that's basically what I imagined an implementation would look like. I think we also thought about reading the process table of a process (that way, we don't care what shell/exe it was)(Keith Hill asked "Here's an example (credit's Lee's script) - https://github.com/nightroman/PowerShelf/blob/master/Invoke-Environment.ps1")
