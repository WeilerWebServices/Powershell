Joel Bennett 9:32 AM: 
Describing skype audio call works
  [+] speakers are audible to audience 36ms 
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:32 AM: 
Is this skype still the "official" channel?
Maximo Trinidad 9:33 AM: 
Our MVP CPM lead are using Teams!
Maximo Trinidad 9:33 AM: 
I can see you all!! Hi there!
Knox, Cory 9:33 AM: 
don't forget to record....
Ryan Yates 9:34 AM: 
Yeah we can see the screen :-)
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:34 AM: 
looks good
Knox, Cory 9:34 AM: 
(Y)
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:35 AM: 
a policy thing?
Mike O'Neill 9:35 AM: 
teams only
kvprasoon 9:35 AM: 
policy!
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:35 AM: 
nope
Mike O'Neill 9:35 AM: 
live the dream
Maximo Trinidad 9:35 AM: 
NO
Corey Webster 9:35 AM: 
Time to move to a teams meeting!
Maximo Trinidad 9:35 AM: 
It did it!
Maximo Trinidad 9:35 AM: 
He have control!!
Dean McKenzie 9:35 AM: 
I'm still having issues dialing in
Adil Zia 9:36 AM: 
no more twitch?
Ryan Yates 9:36 AM: 
I was gonna say did you want me to record via OBS if needed and Stream to Twtich
Adil Zia 9:39 AM: 
What will be different in .netcore 3 for posh?
Christoph Bergmeister 9:40 AM: 
wpf/winform support
Pearon, Matthew 9:40 AM: 
Lost the presentation
Maximo Trinidad 9:40 AM: 
Gone!!
Knox, Cory 9:40 AM: 
would that mean that AzureAD/MSOL might work?
Maximo Trinidad 9:41 AM: 
Cool!!
Maximo Trinidad 9:42 AM: 
:P
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:42 AM: 
Could you elaborate on Adil Zia  question? 
What does .net core 3 mean for powershell? 
Joel Francis 9:42 AM: 
Lol
Christoph Bergmeister 9:42 AM: 
the first preview of 3.0 was actually better than the 2nd...
Joel Bennett 9:42 AM: 
I would vote for major version bump with .NET Core 3 (for sxs reasons), given (as you say) you're not following semver anyway.
Christoph Bergmeister 9:42 AM: 
that is just the nature of previews....
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:43 AM: 
(y)
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:44 AM: 
so existing PS 6 scripts should still work on .net core 3
Joel Francis 9:44 AM: 
Relying on magic means many broken things ;) should be fun!
Joel Bennett 9:44 AM: 
@Jonas: yes (that IS an explicit goal/requirement)
Maximo Trinidad 9:46 AM: 
Cool! That's needed. :)
Pearon, Matthew 9:46 AM: 
That is an awesome idea
Christoph Bergmeister 9:46 AM: 
This is the PR on those new rules: https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/pull/1133
kvprasoon 9:46 AM: 
@Joey, save the notes !
Maximo Trinidad 9:47 AM: 
Yeah Save notes
Maximo Trinidad 9:48 AM: 
@Joey 
kvprasoon 9:48 AM: 
Meeting notes in Teams is awesome
Maximo Trinidad 9:48 AM: 
How about PSRemoting? Any changes or enhancements?
 
I recent install and configure Linux Kerberos to connect PSRemote to a Windows AD domain computer. But, it will default to open Windows PowerShell. It there's a way to force to open PowerShell Core.
 
I open a feedback: PowerShell Core should be supported in WinRm from Linux systems #8942
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/8942 
Pearon, Matthew 9:48 AM: 
Need to use vsLiveShare to share out the meeting notes. :)
Maximo Trinidad 9:48 AM: 
Cool!
Ryan Yates 9:48 AM: 
Should I record via OBS from here on in as well?
Joey Aiello 9:48 AM: 
That'd be awesome, Ryan! Thanks!
Ryan Yates 9:49 AM: 
:thumbs:
Maximo Trinidad 9:49 AM: 
I will look for the response.
Maximo Trinidad 9:49 AM: 
Thanks
Joel Bennett 9:49 AM: 
@Max you should drop by Discord and ask about that -- I'm pretty sure you're just using the wrong config name when connecting ;-)
9:49 AM This message wasn't sent to Mike O'Neill. 
That'd be awesome, Ryan! Thanks!
Maximo Trinidad 9:50 AM: 
:P
Maximo Trinidad 9:50 AM: 
Thanks
Roberth Strand 9:51 AM: 
If 7 supports 6 scripts.. 
Ryan Yates 9:51 AM: 
Please no
Ryan Yates 9:51 AM: 
We don't really need another PSModulePath
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:52 AM: 
as long as you don't break an existing ps6 deployment when you install 7 side by side
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:52 AM: 
(y)
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:52 AM: 
just to calm down operations guys 
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:53 AM: 
fair
Joel Bennett 9:53 AM: 
So if .NET Core 3 isn't LTS, neither PS 6 nor PS 7 will be LTS?
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:54 AM: 
following .NET Core makes sense to more people ... or is easy to explain at least
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:54 AM: 
screen is here
Maximo Trinidad 9:54 AM: 
Save file!
Joey Aiello 9:56 AM: 
PS 7.0 would not be LTS, but some PS 7.x would be LTS when .NET Core 3.x releases an LTS branch
Joey Aiello 9:56 AM: 
But PS 6 would never get an LTS
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:56 AM: 
Oh that is a new thing ... so there will actually be a upgrade of 5.1? 
Maximo Trinidad 9:56 AM: 
lol
Michael Smith (c) 9:57 AM: 
5.1 until you convert exchange :-)
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:57 AM: 
*argh* guests ..... 

Have a nice day/evening :) 
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:57 AM: 
ps. Keep up the good work :D
Jonas Sommer Nielsen 9:59 AM: 
sounds good 
Adil Zia 9:59 AM: 
Will we be able to update to 7 and or later by just running a single command.... like we can for update modules
Maximo Trinidad 9:59 AM: 
(y)(y)
Ryan Yates 9:59 AM: 
Experimental Features in 6.2.0-preview4??
Joey Aiello 10:00 AM: 
On non-Windows, of course! :) Just use your package manager
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:00 AM: 
@ryan, what about that exactly?
Joey Aiello 10:00 AM: 
On Windows, it's a hard problem to do right unfortunately....
Adil Zia 10:00 AM: 
:'(
Joel Bennett 10:00 AM: 
just write your own provider for PackageManagement
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:01 AM: 
@joel, weâ€™ve had discussions about that several times in the past, never really got anywhere with that for various reasons
Joey Aiello 10:01 AM: 
Not supported, but this does mostly do what you want: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/tools/install-powershell.ps1 
Adil Zia 10:01 AM: 
yay
Ryan Yates 10:02 AM: 
specifically the inclusion of this https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/8109 and future experimental feature plans
Christoph Bergmeister 10:02 AM: 
I don't mind about telemetry, people that don't like it can turn it off anyway
Keith Hill 10:03 AM: 
Telemetry on loaded extensions would be handy for extension authors.
kvprasoon 10:05 AM: 
Experimental features are a kind of preview within preview release 
Christoph Bergmeister 10:07 AM: 
Rss is still fine but I got a couple of new unreads
Aleksandar 10:08 AM: 
comments won't be migrated?
Ryan Yates 10:09 AM: 
it seemed to auto pull into the PowerShell Slack
Ryan Yates 10:09 AM: 
the new Blog URL that is
JB Lewis 10:10 AM: 
Going back to July, there are no comments
Corey Webster 10:10 AM: 
Thanks for doing a awesome job!
Keith Hill 10:10 AM: 
What are the plans for PS sessions at the MVP Summit?
Ryan Yates 10:11 AM: 
NDA still Keith
Keith Hill 10:11 AM: 
:-)
kvprasoon 10:11 AM: 
Hope the team will be available @PSConfAsia 2019
kvprasoon 10:12 AM:

Ryan Yates 10:12 AM: 
PSDayUK Call for Speakers is open too - https://sessionize.com/psdayuk-2019
Maximo Trinidad 10:13 AM: 
I love the suggestion feature from the Experimental Features.
Maximo Trinidad 10:15 AM: 
:)
Corey Webster 10:15 AM: 
(flex)
Adam Murray 10:15 AM: 
Just tested that experimental feature too. Great
Keith Hill 10:15 AM:
