Sean Wheeler 9:37 AM: 
yes
Mark Kraus 9:37 AM: 
audio works for me
Randal H 9:37 AM:

Nicholas M. Getchell 9:37 AM: 
We have audio
Justino Garcia 9:37 AM: 
no
Michael T Lombardi 9:37 AM: 
loud and reasonably clear
Randal H 9:38 AM: 
hmmm
Randal H 9:38 AM: 
nothing here
Joey Aiello 9:38 AM: 
you should probably quit and rejoin if you're having sound problems
Joey Aiello 9:38 AM: 
Sorry...
Joey Aiello 9:38 AM: 
Happens to me every 10th time
Michael T Lombardi 9:38 AM: 
If you‚Äôre like me, verify your volume is actually turned up. /sigh
Thomas Rayner 9:38 AM:

Nicholas M. Getchell 9:51 AM: 
So no serialization? 
Joel Bennett 9:51 AM: 
correct
Mark Kraus 9:51 AM: 
correct.. you cannot export-cllixml and such

Joel Bennett 9:55 AM: 
I'd rather not see specific _tools_ promoted into a dev pack -- any time Microsoft "picks a winner" or builds their own, the competition (and improvements) wither.
Mark Kraus 9:56 AM: 
Plans to bring on some more community maintainers with merge privs?
Ryen Tang 9:56 AM: 
Hmm... can't we have a cmdlet in PSCore.. say Get-PSUpdate?
Itadder 9:57 AM: 
what about powershell management tool for mac os with SCCM or intunes
Itadder 9:57 AM: 
Automate Macos Deployment via powershell
Thomas Rayner 9:58 AM: 
Off topic but just remembered: Any plans to change PSSA in such a way that script-based rules can be contributed to the core ruleset? David Wilson opened an issue for it on my behalf a while ago.
Itadder 9:58 AM: 
thanks
Michael T Lombardi 10:00 AM: 
++ keeping installer stuff out of the gallery
DarwinJS 10:00 AM: 
But you stood up Linux Repos? Isn&apos;t it time for an equivalent for Windows?
Joel Bennett 10:01 AM: 
Chocolatey :-P
Michael T Lombardi 10:01 AM: 
choco++
DarwinJS 10:01 AM: 
I love Choco - but need something more official like the Linux repos
Keith Hill 10:01 AM: 
+1
Itadder 10:02 AM: 
yes
Itadder 10:02 AM: 
the equiilivenent
Itadder 10:02 AM: 
of the fleets
Michael T Lombardi 10:02 AM: 
@DarwinJS, you mean like an MS maintained feed?
Itadder 10:02 AM: 
or like get mac eventlogs
DarwinJS 10:02 AM: 
Hey - let&apos;s package windows stuff in RPMs!!!! :S
Itadder 10:02 AM: 
Got it thanks
Michael B. 10:02 AM: 
that has a snowball&apos;s chance
Michael T Lombardi 10:03 AM: 
ie, a nuget feed of chocolatey packages that are MS blessed for installing pwsh and similar?
Michael B. 10:03 AM: 
MDM/OMI
DarwinJS 10:03 AM: 
Windows Store is so NOT DevOps - can&apos;t you get the Windows Store to do a NuGet feed
Ryen Tang 10:04 AM: 
I'm thinking... the same.
Keith Hill 10:04 AM: 
Like NuGet used to do with install.ps1
DarwinJS 10:05 AM: 
It only does that inside VisualStudio right?
Keith Hill 10:05 AM: 
Good question. Honestly, I&apos;ve only used NuGet inside VS. :-)
Joel Bennett 10:06 AM: 
I believe they stopped doing that, because security
Castillo, Joshua 10:06 AM: 
Like dockerhub'ish
Marcus Clayton 10:06 AM: 
Yes!
Keith Hill 10:06 AM: 
Yeah, install.ps1 got dropped in what, v3?
Michael T Lombardi 10:06 AM: 
signed, blessed feeds is my personal preference and matches a bit better the Linux world / expectations
Joel Bennett 10:07 AM: 
Yes, and Darwin's right they never did that outside VS
Jeff Dean 10:07 AM: 
did sound die?
Michael T Lombardi 10:08 AM: 
@Jeff, not for me.
Nichols, Colin 10:08 AM: 
I lost audio
Nicholas M. Getchell 10:08 AM: 
Audio is fine here
Jeremiah Strong 10:08 AM: 
audio is still working for me
Jeff Dean 10:08 AM: 
I'm called in. Calling bakc in
Jeff Dean 10:09 AM: 
still no sound... :(
Joey Aiello 10:09 AM: 
Sorry you're not getting sound....you have to close the window if you exit and rejoin the call for it to actually restart your connection to the call
Thomas Rayner 10:10 AM: 
https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/743  - I don't have a more intelligent question than "can you please do this?" :D
DarwinJS 10:10 AM: 
No notes for the chocolatey conversion? Is it off the record :D
Michael T Lombardi 10:11 AM: 
;)
Joey Aiello 10:12 AM: 
@Darwin: Tyler is typing notes for me, I'm going to go and punch them up with my thoughts before I publish them ;-)
DarwinJS 10:12 AM: 
coo!
Tyler Leonhardt (POWERSHELL) 10:12 AM: 
Notes are hard
DarwinJS 10:12 AM: 
Agreed
DarwinJS 10:13 AM: 
Why isn&apos;t there a bot for that?
Thomas Rayner 10:13 AM: 
Any comments specifically on script-based rule support for the core ruleset?
DarwinJS 10:13 AM: 
How far back would PS compat analysis go?
DarwinJS 10:14 AM: 
Nice
Jeff Dean 10:15 AM: 
I guess I wasn't destined to hear the rest of the call. /shrug/ Don't ya'll have a great text to speech engine for closed captioning? (sorry, off topic)
Keith Hill 10:15 AM: 
IMO perf in PSSA is pretty important

Joey Aiello 10:17 AM:

Thomas Rayner 10:17 AM: 
Thanks for the answer! Appreciate the transparency.
Thomas Rayner 10:17 AM: 
Issue about to have a birthday :)
Jeff Dean 10:17 AM: 
No worries. Appreciate ya'lls time for the calls. I'll catch up later.

Mark Kraus 10:26 AM: 
good call everyone! I have to drop off early. Joey, keep hounding the OS and product teams for those modules. 
Thomas Rayner 10:26 AM: 
I think I reg'd for that session. Can't remember what it was up against.
Thomas Rayner 10:26 AM: 
Reminder: you can nominate David for MVP award May 1.
Michael T Lombardi 10:26 AM:

Michael T Lombardi 10:28 AM: 
I do!
DarwinJS 10:29 AM: 
Nah, just use the SSH client in the windows git folder ;)
Thomas Rayner 10:29 AM: 
bash -c 'ssh ...'
Nicholas M. Getchell 10:31 AM: 
nice
DarwinJS 10:32 AM: 
What will having ssh in win32 mean for updatges via chocolatey?
Michael B. 10:32 AM: 
PSRP perf imp in ssh?
Keith Hill 10:32 AM: 
BTW is PSRL 2 still on track to make it into 6.1?
Michael T Lombardi 10:32 AM:

@DarwinJS++
Michael T Lombardi 10:33 AM: 
doc revs++++++
DarwinJS 10:33 AM: 
System32 placement is going to muck up all existing SSH clients that rely on the path right?
Michael T Lombardi 10:34 AM: 
concept docs++
DarwinJS 10:34 AM: 
Yep
DarwinJS 10:35 AM: 
Program Files/Microsoft
DarwinJS 10:35 AM: 
and then add to end of path
DarwinJS 10:35 AM: 
Git client ssh not on path
DarwinJS 10:35 AM: 
sure
DarwinJS 10:36 AM: 
Whew - hard to get that project to change their install alll - from experience
Michael B. 10:36 AM: 
but you have to know the one-liner...
DarwinJS 10:37 AM: 
Should be off on Desktop OS
Campbell, Troy 10:39 AM: 
I think it should be on by default, if it is a workable ssh client
Campbell, Troy 10:39 AM: 
there should be no reason for git ssh with this release
Nicholas M. Getchell 10:39 AM: 
We definitely want it preinstalled 
Campbell, Troy 10:40 AM: 
Windows Insiders just need to test those issues
Michael T Lombardi 10:41 AM: 
/me throws in an ask for the DSC core update at the last second
Michael B. 10:42 AM: 
if it&apos;s already there - don&apos;t install it again
Michael B. 10:44 AM: 
YES
Nicholas M. Getchell 10:45 AM: 
Is that why RSAT tools have to be reinstalled after every build install?
Michael B. 10:47 AM: 
do ship a where.exe :-)
DarwinJS 10:47 AM: 
get-command
DarwinJS 10:47 AM: 
No sorry
DarwinJS 10:52 AM: 
get-command should find arbitrary .exes - only on the path
Keith Hill 10:52 AM: 
So shooting for RS4?
Keith Hill 10:53 AM: 
Gotcha
Sean Wheeler 10:54 AM: 
where.exe ships in Windows already
Michael B. 10:54 AM: 
yes. since server 2003
Michael B. 10:54 AM:
