We hear yo
Mike O'Neill 9:32 AM: 
y
Kohls, Daniel 9:32 AM: 
Yes
Kohls, Daniel 9:32 AM: 
Sounds good
Joel Francis 9:32 AM: 
It sounds pretty good
Roberth Strand 9:32 AM: 
Sounds like persons talking
Mike O'Neill 9:32 AM: 
a little off
Adil Zia 9:32 AM: 
Terminators
Mike O'Neill 9:32 AM: 
but ok
Thomas Rayner 9:33 AM: 
Off to a great start :D
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:33 AM: 
almost ready
Mike O'Neill 9:34 AM: 
PowerShell can fix it!
Francois-Xavier Cat 9:34 AM: 
Hi
Mike O'Neill 9:34 AM: 
that's better
Hager Constantin 9:34 AM: 
yes
Joel Francis 9:34 AM: 
Yup!
Mike O'Neill 9:35 AM: 
and a screen
Hager Constantin 9:35 AM: 
no screen
Mike O'Neill 9:35 AM: 
now no screen
Joel Francis 9:35 AM: 
So full there's no room for the camera
Joel Francis 9:35 AM: 
Also screen is still black if it's not supposed to be
Joel Francis 9:36 AM: 
Good!
Kirk Munro 9:42 AM: 
Any comments on when the PowerShell Module folder location will be moved out of OneDrive?
Mike O'Neill 9:43 AM: 
Look at what's happening in our cadence of OS and app releases...they are slowing them down
Christoph Bergmeister 9:43 AM: 
having an equivalen of a version with LTS support would be great
Thomas Rayner 9:43 AM: 
gotta go to scrum, see you all in 15 min :P
Mike O'Neill 9:44 AM: 
Windows
Mike O'Neill 9:44 AM: 
Office on premises
Joel Francis 9:44 AM: 
Nooo Tom come baack
Joel Francis 9:44 AM: 
:P
Christoph Bergmeister 9:44 AM: 
it takes a while to develop, test and ship, 6 months is not 'enterprise friendly'
Mike O'Neill 9:44 AM: 
think of customers with 100K plus seats
Mike O'Neill 9:44 AM: 
they are moving slower
Mike O'Neill 9:45 AM: 
yes...many of the 'smaller' customers can keep up
Mullick, Ayan 9:45 AM: 
Will the PowerShell core version updates be included in Windows Updates?
Mullick, Ayan 9:48 AM: 
ok. Great. Thanks
Mullick, Ayan 9:49 AM: 
Hemant mentioned on one of the Ignite sessions that VSC would eventually replace PS ISE. Is there anywhere on GitHub where one could point out the ISE features one misses in VSC?
Adil Zia 9:49 AM: 
I like powershell updating automatically via some mechanism
Michael B Smith 9:49 AM: 
requires 1809 or above, doesn't it?
Darwin Sanoy 9:49 AM: 
Yet another packager command line to figure out :(
Adil Zia 9:49 AM: 
if that happens
Michael B Smith 9:49 AM: 
MSIX that is
Joey Aiello 9:49 AM:

Adil Zia 9:50 AM: 
AM I GETTING BACK MY OUT_GRIDVBIEW IN VSCODE!!?
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 9:50 AM: 
@michael, I haven’t looked closely at MSIX myself yet. Travis on my team is the expert but he’s on vacation right now. If that is true, we’ll have to figure out a story for older Windows
Mullick, Ayan 9:51 AM: 
ok. Thanks (y)
Joey Aiello 9:51 AM: 
https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/blob/master/docs/ise_compatibility.md
Keith Hill 9:51 AM: 
If you're using PS 5.x in the PSIC then Out-GridView still works. 
Michael B Smith 9:52 AM: 
yes, v1809 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/msix-packaging-tool/9n5lw3jbcxkf?activetab=pivot:overviewtab
Joel Francis 9:55 AM: 
Someone in the PS Slack has a semi-working OSX ogv
Joel Francis 9:55 AM: 
It looks fun
Adam Murray 9:55 AM: 
Joel posted this for out-gridview - https://t.co/dlhBkKfP1N 
Joel Francis 9:56 AM: 
Ah I remember that
Joel Francis 9:56 AM: 
Think it was @sifb or someone else who got a GUI version of it in osx as well 
Joel Francis 9:56 AM: 
Yeah that's the other Joel :P
Michael B Smith 9:59 AM: 
what did you do about $returns
Michael B Smith 10:00 AM: 
<raise hand>
Joel Francis 10:04 AM: 
Consistency with PowerShell behaviour should be considered imo
Michael B Smith 10:04 AM: 
there is an RFC on it :-)
Michael B Smith 10:05 AM: 
i thought there was
Michael B Smith 10:05 AM: 
ok, sorry.
Joey Aiello 10:05 AM: 
https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-powershell-worker/issues/82
Michael B Smith 10:08 AM: 
i want to complain about COM objects. but that's not PS core. :-)
Thomas Rayner 10:08 AM: 
I think I missed the announcement if there was one. Who owns PSGallery stuff now?
Thomas Rayner 10:08 AM: 
And does that person own the powershellget module?
Keith Hill 10:08 AM: 
Add this to your profile: Set-Alias nano 'C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\nano.exe'
Set-Alias vim 'C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\vim.exe'
Sydney Smith 10:09 AM: 
I own both PSGallery and the PSget module now
Thomas Rayner 10:09 AM: 
Good to know. Thanks, Sydney :)
Joel Francis 10:09 AM: 
Let's just make another client editor lol
Keith Hill 10:09 AM: 
I'd prefer VIM over Emacs. :-)
Joel Francis 10:09 AM: 
Thatll go well
Adil Zia 10:09 AM: 
So maybe cuz i havent done it in core... but how would you like ..manage and edit office files...like say excel....in core... cuz in 5x it was com...and that..was and is horrendous
Joel Francis 10:09 AM: 
*cli
Thomas Rayner 10:10 AM: 
Collect telemetry on noobs trying to exit vim and use it for a random string generator
Joel Francis 10:10 AM: 
Hahaha
Keith Hill 10:10 AM: 
Nano and VIM comes with Git
Joel Francis 10:11 AM: 
No they come with
Keith Hill 10:11 AM: 
Yes it always come with it
Joel Francis 10:11 AM: 
You have a toggleable setting
Keith Hill 10:11 AM: 
So you use an alias
Keith Hill 10:12 AM: 
usr/bin
Joel Francis 10:12 AM: 
And you can choose to have it added to the path on install
Joel Francis 10:12 AM: 
There is a nano
Keith Hill 10:12 AM: 
Set-Alias vim 'C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\vim.exe'
Michael B Smith 10:12 AM: 
and if you have VIM you have EX :-)
Joel Francis 10:13 AM: 
Is it too late in the year to ask after lengthy PRs and should I wait till next year? :D
Andrew Bradley 10:13 AM: 
In bash, `set -e` is common to auto-fail every time an external process returns a non-zero exit code. Is there a way to implement something similar in PS? Like hooking into process invocation? I've tried using $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.(post-command-resolution event) but this isn't scoped to my modules so it's leaky

Broadly speaking, unix interop still feels inconvenient because of quirks like this, would be awesome if we could implement better fixes as modules
Joel Francis 10:13 AM: 
Yeah, no I figured haha. You guys should be tidying up by now haha
Joel Francis 10:13 AM: 
Cheers
Darwin Sanoy 10:16 AM: 
Trap statement
Joey Aiello 10:16 AM: 
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/88
Keith Hill 10:16 AM: 
Any chance the PS build.psm1 function Start-NativeExecution could be made a built-in function?
Darwin Sanoy 10:17 AM: 
This Windows Tar is not packaged anywhere?
Darwin Sanoy 10:17 AM: 
CIS CAT PRO portable only ships as .tar.gz for windows
Michael B Smith 10:17 AM: 
robocopy and psexec were discussed i hope?
Michael B Smith 10:17 AM: 
i haven't read that RFC yet
Keith Hill 10:17 AM: 
We have copied it and use it all the time in build/test scripts.
Keith Hill 10:18 AM: 
Got a few funny looks when our builds were passing but we had obvious native exe failures in our build log.
Andrew Bradley 10:21 AM: 
Just as an aside, no need to discuss further:
To enforce exit code checking globally, I've done $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.PostCommandLookupAction = {<# script block that replaces all native commands with script blocks that check $LASTEXITCODE #> but it's a total hack
Darwin Sanoy 10:21 AM: 
http://libarchive.org/downloads/
Adil Zia 10:21 AM: 
what replaced the functionality of COM in core... as horrible as it was.... I dont know what replaced the functionality of say...excel automation and report generation or editing.... just curious..I apologize for my ignorance...
Keith Hill 10:22 AM: 
Yup, our version of Start-NativeExecution allows you to pass in an array of success codes.
Adil Zia 10:23 AM: 
thanks
Darwin Sanoy 10:24 AM: 
So this tar tool ships in Windows, is it considered the Official version then?
Darwin Sanoy 10:24 AM: 
I see lotsa other nasty ways of getting tar on windows
Christoph Bergmeister 10:25 AM: 
one note about COM in PSCore: WPS uses MTA but PSCore uses STA
Steve Lee (POWERSHELL) 10:25 AM: 
Keith, maybe you could pkg that as a module on psgallery :)
Michael B Smith 10:25 AM: 
where.exe works in Windows since Server 2003
Keith Hill 10:25 AM: 
+1
Christoph Bergmeister 10:26 AM: 
sorry, the other way around
Joel Francis 10:26 AM: 
What that means should be documented somewhere haha
Joel Francis 10:26 AM: 
Like on the page where you list the parameter options for powershell
Joel Francis 10:27 AM: 
Hahahahaha
Christoph Bergmeister 10:27 AM: 
we had a perf impact on WPS because [Management.Automation.PowerShell]::Create() was using MTA by default and not STA as one would expect
Joel Francis 10:27 AM: 
Can of worms lol
Christoph Bergmeister 10:28 AM: 
more details are documented/discussed here: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6908
Hager Constantin 10:28 AM: 
anything new on intellicode support for PowerShell?
Michael B Smith 10:30 AM: 
thanks for the call!
Joel Francis 10:30 AM: 
Have a good and safe Xmas y'all
Adam Murray 10:30 AM: 
Cya
Keith Hill 10:30 AM: 
Thanks!
Adil Zia 10:30 AM: 
goo holidays
Hager Constantin 10:30 AM: 
bye
Keith Hill 10:30 AM: 
Have a good one!
Kirk Munro 10:30 AM: 
Merry Christmas everyone.
Christoph Bergmeister 10:30 AM: 
bye, happy xmas
