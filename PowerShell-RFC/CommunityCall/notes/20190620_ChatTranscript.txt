kvprasoon

miss typed Streaming

Hey Joey.. Streamiming its just fine!!
cool

:O for once, a meeting free morning where I can actually attend this!

Joel Sallow
I found some fun things with expression switches work nicely in some places. So nice to have some fancy new C# toys :D

Ryan Yates
Is there a list of these modules that weren't expected to be compatable avail somewhere?

Kirk Munro
Why do you only promote/push RFCs for review here that come from the PS Team? There are other RFCs for review that community members contribute and would like to move forward in the PowerShell 7 timeframe that should be listed here.

What is the roadmap/timeline to ship PowerShell with Windows OS's? And what does that look like?

Can OnError maybe be used to trigger a breakpoint on error? That would be huge to be able to trigger a breakpoint on exception in VSCode instead of "guessing" where the error is

Kirk Munro
There are some well-founded concerns on the differences between bash and PowerShell in the Chaining Operator RFC. It would be helpful if other folks could chime in, particularly those who use bash.

Joel Sallow
They fixed a bunch of formatting things that were thoroughly annoying <3

Mike O'Neill
I'm the one that asked about the update to win OS

Joel Sallow
Also shoutout for the Test-Connection RFC that could probably use some more comments ;)

Kirk Munro
Also regarding the RFC process, the chaining operator RFC needs feedback from the community (bash users need to chime in, not just the PowerShell afficionados who eagerly watch for PRs in that repo), but the current PR feedback system is just horrible (as has been shared). What can we do now to get the right amount of feedback (PowerShell and bash users combined) speficially on the chaining RFC, and other RFCs that are open?

We have break on error and break on exception in a PR that is in progress (`-ErrorAction Break`, and `[ActionPreference]::Break`).

What about Windows Terminal? is as cool as the video showed that? are you pointing to integrate with a Bash console on the same app?

Joey. Why you don't try to take the notes on the same TEAMS app, to share this notes and urls with all of us.-?

Fabian Campo (Col)
thank you.-(Fabian Campo (Col) asked "Joey. Why you don't try to take the notes on the same TEAMS app, to share this notes and urls with all of us.-?")

Does Windows terminal integrate with VSC?

I see your shell

kvprasoon
0 && ls
1 && ls

and in CMD ;)
|| and && also work in CMD

kvprasoon
@Mike - Win Terminal in VSC, that'll be too much :-)

Is it possible to use || and && in the same statement for two different outcomes?

Joey Aiello
Good question, I'll ask when Rob is finished with this demo(Is it possible to use || and && in the same statement for two different outcomes?)

Joel Sallow
pretty sure combining && and || statements is possible aye, but they have the same precedence if I recall the details of the RFC/PR right

Joel Sallow
As a result, you'll need parentheses or something, probably, to get the results you want a lot of the time

Joel Sallow
I've noticed the more detailed committee review comments & very much appreciate the extra context, it really helps. ΓÖÑ

It might make sense to split Review of RFC out from Comments & Questions of an RFC

Joel Sallow
Google Docs has a comment system

Joel Sallow
it's pretty easy to work with iirc

Joel Bennett
There are quite a few more sophisticated code-review tools -- like Pull Panda ... which GitHub just bought ...

How about on Markdown for help system

Joel Sallow
oh yeah, with the ?? and ? : operator things are we also possibly getting ?. operator?

Edwin Young
In case we don't get to it there's a bit of background on PowerShellGallery outage at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGallery/blob/master/psgallery_status.md

Joel Sallow
Ah, good, you're getting to some xternal committee members... been thinking on that recently hehehe

Mike O'Neill
Are these recorded for others to view later?

Since I've mentioned PullPanda ... you should also try RubberDuck.io for code reviews (not much help for RFCs, imho). 

And I do still like Reviewable because it pushes threading better, keeps track of which comments I've already seen -- which is the hard part of RFC conversations, and maybe even keeps better track of issues that have not actually been decided even if the code around them changes (although I'll admit I haven't used it on anything that churned as much as the PowerShellGet RFC).

Mike O'Neill
ok, thank you.

RE inboxing in Windows - My Expectation is it would come in a Windows Feature Update @mike like OpenSSH client / server did in windows 10 1803

This would IMO be after 7 gets released
