great ! will it be included in pwsh 7 than or stay as a standalone module

Aaron Nelson
I know that double-WHERE is valid, but isn't that more expensive than doing WHERE with -and?

Are there parameters to control what text that button shows, whether or not there is a Cancel button, etc.?

Kirk
"that button" = the Export button(Kirk asked "Are there parameters to control what text that button shows, whether or not there is a Cancel button, etc.?")

prasoon
better if the shown code uses named parameters,
missing -FilterScript here  :-)

James Maxson
Maybe get-help -showwindow?

James Maxson
show-help would work(James Maxson asked "Maybe get-help -showwindow?")

I have nothing to announce at this time.  It is a very highly requested item.

Ayan
Would one need the compatipility module, in PowerShell 7 too, to run basic cmdlets like Restart-Computer on linux\Mac?

Aaron Nelson
Ping @VickyHarp & @SQLToolsGuy on twitter about putting the SqlServer module up on GitHub.  They are very well aware of this need, and I need to let them handle messaging on this topic, at this time.

Joey Aiello
No, the compatibility module works through Windows PowerShell / .NET in order to run those Windows PS cmdlets. 

We may invest in native binary wrappers for macOS/Linux in the future, but nothing we're committing to now(Ayan asked "Would one need the compatipility module, in PowerShell 7 too, to run basic cmdlets like Restart-Computer on linux\Mac?")

Do you know if the Active Directory module is being reworked to support PowerShell core? If so is there a rough release date for it? 

Robin Dadswell
that's great but there are things about using it on other OS as well that it seems to be missing(Robin Dadswell asked "Do you know if the Active Directory module is being reworked to support PowerShell core? If so is there a rough release date for it? ")

It does work with a caveat that isn't resolved until .NET Core 3 iirc -- there's a broken property if you do Get-ADUser -Properties * that breaks it completely. There's an issue in the PSModuleCompatibility repo detailing it.

The Get-AdUser will be fixed in preview3 due to it being fixed in an update of .Net Core

Someone should had a VT renderer to out-gridview ;) That would probably shed 275MB of that 280MB and still be xplat :P

By the way, the issue/PR notifications in GitHub were useful to see which fixes shipped as part of the 6.2.2 and 7.0.0-preview.2 releases
