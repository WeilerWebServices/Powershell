## Description

The **xRemoteDesktopAdmin** module contains the **xRemoteDesktopAdmin** DSC Resource.
This DSC Resource allows you to configure remote desktop settings to either allow or prevent users to setup a remote desktop connection to a specific machine.
In addition, it can optionally leverage the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration resources **xFirewall** and **xGroup**.
This allows you to configure remote desktop settings and create the necessary firewall rules to allow a remote session and add a domain user to the local Remote Desktop Users group.

## Examples

### [ExampleConfiguration-RemoteDesktopAdmin.ps1](Examples/ExampleConfiguration-RemoteDesktopAdmin.ps1)

This configuration configures the target system to allow for remote connections (i.e. allows an RDP session to be setup), enables Network Level Authentication and creates a Windows firewall rule to allow incoming RDP traffic.

### [ExampleConfiguration-RemoteDesktopAdminWithUnEncryptedPassword.ps1](Examples/ExampleConfiguration-RemoteDesktopAdminWithUnEncryptedPassword.ps1)

This configuration extends the previous configuration by adding a domain user to the local Remote Desktop Users group using a credential stored in clear text (for testing purposes only).
Note: this Example requires the built-in **Group** resource.

### [ExampleConfiguration-RemoteDesktopAdminWithEncryptedPassword.ps1](Examples/ExampleConfiguration-RemoteDesktopAdminWithEncryptedPassword.ps1)

This configuration extends the previous configuration by adding a domain user to the local Remote Desktop Users group using certificates to encrypt credentials.
